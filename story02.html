A JOINT PROJECT OF BROOKINGS AND JPMORGAN CHASE<br><br>
全球与美国国内商品贸易（城市之间）<br><br>
Metro-to-Metro:<br><br>
Global and Domestic Goods Trade in Metropolitan America<br><br>
Adie Tomer, Robert Puentes, and Joseph Kane<br><br>

“ Despite the focus on the national trade deficit, every metro area has trade surpluses in at least one commodity, and almost all in more than one.”<br><br>

Executive Summary<br><br>
The amount and value of goods that the United States trades every year is astonishing. In 2010,
the country moved more than $3 trillion in goods internationally or nearly $8.8 billion, on average,
each day. Without a doubt, the trading of physical goods is a major component of the U.S.
economy.<br><br>
However, an exclusive focus on national trade obscures trading relationships among places as
different as New York City and Wyoming and overlooks the important variations in metropolitan
economies. When policies gauge trade only at the national level―and focus solely on the macroeconomic
trends affecting it―they miss extreme regional variety in production, consumption, and
goods exchange.<br><br>
This discussion paper marks the first time metropolitan areas can begin to explore their place
in domestic and global goods trade networks. Metropolitan trade volumes track which regions
generate the most international trade and the level of trade within the much larger domestic
marketplace, resulting in a more comprehensive picture of metropolitan and non-metropolitan
trading relationships.<br><br>
Overall, the analysis shows that the 100 largest American metropolitan areas trade the greatest
volume of and the most valuable goods. Products leaving these places are worth more than the
products entering them. In particular, metro areas that specialize in the most advanced industrial
products, such as electronics and precision instruments, tend to trade goods with an average
volume significantly higher than other places. These places are also more globally oriented than
the rest of the country.<br><br>
Unpacking trade balances at the subnational scale also shows that, despite the focus on the
national trade deficit, every metro area has trade surpluses in at least one commodity, and
almost all in more than one. These surpluses are a promising sign for metro areas looking to
boost their trade and production levels, even in places with deep aggregate deficits.<br><br>
This new measurement of goods exchange at the subnational scale raises important questions
about the interrelated nature of modern economies, and it has implications for new approaches
to trade and investment. Through this work, we hope to engage a new group of innovative thinkers,
practitioners, and policymakers and provide metro leaders with an understanding of their
economic starting point on what they trade, where they trade, and how that trade relates to their
regional peers. The goal is to enable them to consider new innovative practices from other metro
areas and integrate goods movement into their broader transportation plans and economic
development programs, especially around exports.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T2">I. Introduction</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>

As Jane Jacobs famously wrote, “The economic foundation of cities is trade.”1 Without the
ability to efficiently and reliably exchange goods, countries and their metropolitan areas
would be forced to subsist solely on the resources available within their borders. Although
much economic activity in cities serves the needs of the local market, it does not have the
same impact on economic growth as trading goods and services outside city boundaries.2<br><br>
To connect cities and metropolitan areas with one another, today’s trade networks rely on a complex
mix of freight and telecommunications infrastructure, low trade barriers, as well as international business
and social networks. This exchange defines the world economy. In the past two decades alone,
global goods trade grew by more than 400 percent, dwarfing the growth rate of global gross domestic
product (GDP).3<br><br>
Metropolitan areas drive that global trade. In 2012, just 300 metropolitan areas produced 51 percent
of global economic output.4 Developing the unique economic specialties that allow these metro areas
to flourish―from chemical and oil facilities in Houston, to machinery and electronics manufacturing
in Germany’s Ruhr region, to textile and electronics plants in Shenzhen, China―would be impossible
without the modern trade networks and supply chains that connect firms and consumers to products
made around the world.<br><br>
Unfortunately, metro area leaders do not have comprehensive information on what they trade, with
whom, or how goods are moved from one place to another. Trade statistics are often only presented
at the national level and focus solely on country-to-country trade. This not only ignores the primacy
of metro-to-metro trade on the global stage, but it also fails to capture all the domestic trade between
metro areas within the United States. As a result, metropolitan leaders from the public and private
sector are unable to fully understand their place in domestic and global trade networks.<br><br>
This paper is part of a research and policy series designed to address this deficiency by assessing
goods trade at the metropolitan scale.5 It will help metro leaders better understand their local economies,
shape new strategies for freight movement and logistics, and identify trading partners. It uses a
unique and comprehensive database to capture all the goods moving in and out of U.S. metropolitan
areas, both domestically and beyond. Future reports will describe how goods move between metropolitan
areas via different modes of transportation and will uncover the specific trading relationships
between U.S. metropolitan areas as well as their global counterparts.<br><br>
This first report begins with background information on the history of goods trade and its measurement.
It reports on subnational goods trade volumes and assesses trends across specific commodities
and geographic lines. It also reports on the difference between the amount and type of freight a
metropolitan area trades with other places and how this measure relates to local industry profiles. It
concludes with a discussion of the possible implications for trade, industry, and public policy.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T3">II. Background</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Firms and households in metropolitan areas produce and consume a variety of goods. Endowed
with a distinct set of local assets, metro areas use an assortment of inputs―namely
land, labor, and capital―to build wealth and drive growth. By gaining access to markets
around the world, metropolitan firms specialize in creating different products and exchange
them for commodities produced in other regions.6 Over time, through these physical connections, they
bring in new resources and generate additional output, allowing them to expand the scope of their
productive activities and meet higher levels of supply and demand.7<br><br>
Transportation enables this trade. An expansive network of multiple modes of transportation serves
as a foundation for regional economies.8 From roads and rails to ports and pipes, this network moves
goods between distant places and matches production with consumption.9 In recent decades, freight’s
ability to shrink the distance between places through lower costs and greater reliability made possible
the global value chains of today.10<br><br>
Trade balances and volumes are vital to understanding these value chains.11 Essentially, trade balances
are a gauge of a nation’s comparative advantage relative to various economic forces, ranging from currency exchange rates to local firms’ supplies and demands.12 Understanding how many goods
flow in and out of a particular place can help guide future investments in both industry and infrastructure.<br><br>
With greater exports, for instance, metro areas can benefit from their production specializations
and economies of scale to increase output, accelerate job growth, and become more globally competitive.<br><br>
 
With the advent of mercantilism in the 16th century, nations began to examine how exports and
imports influenced their ability to amass resources, wealth, and power in an imperialist world order.<br><br>
Thomas Mun, along with several European economists and merchants at the time, called on countries
to quantify their balance of trade, while promoting exports and minimizing imports as part of a coordinated
national strategy.14<br><br>
Other classical economists reoriented this thinking. They argued that trade could lead to mutual
gains among nations that developed specializations and engaged actively in exchanging goods, a
concept that now serves as a cornerstone for modern economics.15 These positive gains from trade
resulted when nations drew from their unique endowments to produce certain kinds of goods, which
they could then exchange for capital and other inputs.16 The idea of free trade, in other words, took on
a new meaning, as nations interacted through a more open exchange of goods.17<br><br>
The nature of global trade further refines how nations view goods movement. Because many countries
today rely on service-oriented economies, a deficit in goods trade carries an entirely different
meaning than it did in the past. Rather than aim exclusively for a goods trade surplus, countries and
their metropolitan anchors also generate value through services. Occupations like product designers,
managers, and marketing specialists all create value without actually touching a traded good.<br><br>
Likewise, deficits in particular commodities are often seen as essential ingredients to fuel both service
and goods-producing industries. Imports allow all modern industries and economies to function.<br><br>
For example, America’s economic versatility―first in developing a comparative advantage in agricultural
exports and then shifting to the manufacture and export of high-value goods―helped the country
generate consistent surpluses in international goods trade starting in the 1870s.18 However, as it transitioned
to a more service-oriented economy, the United States saw its overall goods trade balance
slide into consistent deficits starting in the 1960s.19 This is typical in modern times: at the same time
the U.S. goods trade deficit grew to $59.3 billion, it also saw its largest service sector surplus, $13.6
billion.20<br><br>
However, these national figures only tell part of the story.<br><br>
The reality of modern trade is between metropolitan areas.21 Clusters of firms, workers, and infrastructure
form the primary nodes in global value chains, and those assets are located in metropolitan
areas. In many cases, these nodes are not merely the points of distribution in the value chains, but
also the factories that transform raw commodities into finished products, design products in research
labs, and market and sell those products in office spaces.<br><br>
This is especially true in the United States. The 100 largest metropolitan areas contain two-thirds of
the country’s population, generate 75 percent of its economic output, and are its centers of advanced
manufacturing, innovation, human capital, and technology.22 They house dense collections of industries
that draw from the energies of a skilled workforce and the conveniences offered by their infrastructure
networks to create dynamic economies that could not exist in isolation.23 Large metropolitan
areas demonstrate a nation’s global fluency and long-term international trading potential.24<br><br>
Yet despite their economic stature, metro areas lack a comprehensive picture of the products they
move and trade with each other. This new analysis begins to explore those relationships.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T4">III. Methodology</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
This report reveals, for the first time, domestic and international goods movement at the
metropolitan scale across a variety of measures, including value and weight. It includes all
types of goods and commodities, via all modes of transportation. It includes everything from
precision surgical equipment on airplanes, to crude oil in pipelines, to consumer products on
ships, to scrap metal on trucks, to coal on trains.<br><br>
To develop these measures, Brookings worked with the Economic Development Research Group

(EDR) to create a unique data set modified from the Freight Analysis Framework (FAF), produced by
the U.S. Department of Transportation. The framework provides information on freight movement to,
from, and within the United States. It uses 43 different commodity categories and seven transportation
modes.25 However, FAF does not capture origin-destination trade flows between most metropolitan
areas, nor does it provide broad country-level detail for international trade.<br><br>
Therefore, Brookings and EDR reallocated FAF’s original flows to metropolitan areas, which are
groups of adjacent counties that qualify under core based statistical area (CBSA) definitions. In this
report, any flows not within the metropolitan areas are referred to as “non-metropolitan areas” and
assigned to specific “state remainders.” All trade flows, especially international flows, link trade volumes
more directly to domestic and global economic activity. This analysis focuses on where goods
are produced and consumed
versus the sites of international
crossing.26 The report uses a
new “crosswalk” between FAF
and Moody’s Analytics data to
develop a unique set of 15 commodity
groups.<br><br>
This original database offers
the most detailed picture of
intermetropolitan freight movement
to date.27 It estimates
inter-regional freight flows in
2010 by commodity type and
transportation mode across
409 domestic areas (361 metropolitan
areas and 48 state
remainders) and 40 international
geographies (18 countries,
11 larger country groups,
and 11 continental remainders).<br><br>
Appendix A describes these
methods in greater detail.<br><br>
Given the emphasis on
economic production, this
report concentrates primarily
on measures of value rather
than weight. Value illustrates
patterns in the economic worth
of individual commodities and
their relationship to larger
global value chains. Weight
relates more closely to the
specific transportation modes
and ports that help move goods
as part of these global value
chains and will be the focus of a
future report.<br><br>

Regional Geography: This report subdivides the United States into individual and aggregate
regions based on metropolitan area definitions.28 One group is the 100 largest metropolitan
areas, as measured by population from the 2010 decennial census. The next group is all other
metropolitan areas, which for this project includes another 261 metropolitan areas.29 The final
group is the remaining parts of the country, referenced as non-metropolitan areas.<br><br>
Goods Trade: The physical exchange of products or commodities between two distinct trading
partners. These exchanges encompass the full range of commodities, from the rawest natural
resources such as stones to the most advanced manufacturing products such as aerospace
equipment.<br><br>
Trade Volume: The total quantity of goods traded in and out of a particular region. It measures
volumes by value (in U.S. dollars), weight (in tons), and value per ton (value divided by weight).<br><br>
Inflows: The volume of goods a region or metro area purchases from other places, reported in
either value or weight. Inflows are subdivided domestically (by domestic destination) and internationally
(by foreign origin). Imports, as such, refer exclusively to international inflows.<br><br>
Outflows: The volume of goods a region sells to other regions and countries, reported in either
value or weight. Outflows are subdivided domestically (by domestic origin) and internationally
(by foreign destination). Exports, as such, refer exclusively to international outflows.<br><br>
Trade Balance: The difference in trade volumes between outflows and inflows. The report
describes trade balances across combinations of trade geography and commodity category.<br><br>
Commodities: This report uses a collection of 15 commodities to better describe the goods that
metropolitan areas trade: agricultural products, stones/ores, energy products, chemicals/plastics,
wood products, textiles, metals, machinery/tools, electronics, transportation equipment,
precision instruments, furniture, waste, mixed freight, and unknown. For more information on
these commodity groups, see Appendix A.<br><br>
Advanced Industries (AI): Industries that invest heavily in research and development and
employ a highly skilled workforce. Their tendency is to consume high-value commodities as
inputs and to produce high-value goods as outputs. The following commodities are most likely
to include AI-produced goods: chemicals/plastics, machinery/tools, electronics, transportation
equipment, and precision instruments.30<br><br>

	<br>
	<b><a name="T6">IV. Metropolitan Trade Volumes</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Nations have tracked the quantity of goods they trade with each other for centuries, helping
to gauge their level of interaction. Yet, those measures often overlook how much nations
trade within their borders, or even which regions drive international trade.31<br><br>
Metropolitan trade volumes offer new insights. They gauge exactly which regions generate
the most international trade. It also provides the ability to examine goods exchanged within the
much larger domestic marketplace. The ability to report both domestic and international trade creates
the statistical bridge to provide a comprehensive picture of metropolitan and non-metropolitan trading
relationships.<br><br>
In 2010, the United States traded more than 17.3 billion tons of freight worth $20.3 trillion domestically
and internationally.32 To put the value in terms of the nation’s economy, national output was $13.1
trillion in 2010, meaning the country transported $1.55 in goods for every $1 of overall output. It also
means an average day sees more than $55 billion and nearly 47 million tons of goods transported.
The nation’s 100 largest metropolitan areas drive those trade numbers. Combined, their total
volume is $12.2 trillion and 7.8 billion tons, which represent 60 percent and 45 percent, respectively,
of goods traded nationally (Figure 1). Considering these metropolitan areas are the more economically
diversified portions of the country, specifically in their concentration of tradable service clusters,
these goods trade shares underscore their enormous presence in national production and consumption
networks.33 In contrast, the country’s non-metropolitan areas move only 18 percent of freight
value and 31 percent of freight weight, while the country’s smaller metropolitan areas move 21 percent
of value and the lowest weight share (24 percent).<br><br>
The highest-volume traders are generally the largest metropolitan economies.34 For example, among
the 10 largest goods traders, only one―Detroit―did not also rank in the top 10 by metropolitan GDP
(Table 1). Collectively, these 10 markets trade more than one-fifth (22 percent) of all national goods
and have larger trade volumes ($4.5 trillion) than the country’s entire non-metropolitan portions combined
($3.7 trillion). Their volumes also exceed the nation’s entire international trading volume, which
was the biggest in the world in 2010.<br><br>

<a href= "pic05.html">Freight Volumes by Geographic Area</a><br><br>



<a href= "pic06.html">Largest Metropolitan Goods Traders</a><br><br>
The composition of a metropolitan economy is a strong indicator of trade volumes.35 Metro areas
with large economies focused on production and consumption of goods (as opposed to services)
generally have higher trade volumes than either population or traditional GDP calculations would
suggest.36 For the 100 largest metro areas, this goods-related composition determines whether they
trade more or less than their similarly sized peers. The San Jose metro area, for instance, ranks 31st
in population and 16th in the size of its economy, yet its total trade in goods ($209.6 billion) ranks 12th,
driven primarily by electronics and precision instruments (Table 1). The situation is similar in New
Orleans (46th in population, 26th in freight volume), Greensboro, NC (71st and 44th), and Toledo, OH (81st
and 57th). Each of these metropolitan economies specializes in tradable goods―energy, chemicals, and transportation equipment, respectively―and each, consequently, has higher freight volumes than their
populations alone would suggest.<br><br>
On the flip-side, the Washington, DC, metro area moves $40 billion less in total goods than San Jose
despite an overall economy twice as large. This does not mean Washington’s economy is weak; rather it
specializes in tradable services like consulting and legal affairs rather than tradable goods. Las Vegas,
Orlando, and Sacramento are similar.<br><br>

Regardless of a metro area’s economic focus, the average value of its traded goods helps indicate
each area’s production specialties and consumption preferences. Higher average values of good
production suggest an economy less focused on raw materials and more on advanced manufacturing.
Consumption demands have a similar effect: higher firm and household incomes create the opportunity
to purchase more expensive products. This, in turn, affects the type of infrastructure needed to
move those goods (i.e., heavy trucks, freight rail or seaports for bulky products, or airports and smaller
trucks for lightweight, expensive items).<br><br>
The largest metro areas show a clear propensity to produce and consume the country’s highestvalued
goods (Figure 2), including those related to advanced industries: chemicals/plastics, machinery/
tools, electronics, transportation equipment, and precision instruments.42 Overall, the average value
per ton of all goods traded in the United States is $1,170. In the 100 largest metropolitan areas, the
average value rises to $1,563 per ton, compared with $680 per ton in the country’s non-metropolitan
regions. As discussed later, these advanced industries matter because they collectively add more
to the economy than is revealed by their respective contributions to productivity, employment, and
wages alone.<br><br>

<a href= "pic07.html">Commodity Groups</a><br><br>
Individual metro areas also stand out in the types of valuable goods they trade. Given the specialization
in telecommunications products and the presence of firms such as Qualcomm, metropolitan
San Diego’s traded goods have the highest average value at $3,445 per ton.43 Other metro areas that
specialize in cutting-edge manufacturing such as Hartford, CT (machinery) and Boston (electronics)
trade relatively high-value, low-weight goods as well.44<br><br>
Yet as Table 2 shows, not all of the 100 largest metropolitan areas specialize in high-value goods.
Metro areas that trade in heavy raw materials such as agriculture (Modesto, CA; Stockton, CA; and
Lakeland, FL) or energy products (New Orleans, Houston, and Baton Rouge) all move goods with
below-average values. In total, 22 of the 100 largest metropolitan areas traded goods with a lower
average value per ton than the national benchmark of $1,170.<br><br>
In some metro areas, a combination of high- and low-value commodities has the greatest influence
on average values. In metropolitan New York, for example, chemicals/plastics are the most traded
commodity. But the metro area ranks very high in average values by also trading large volumes of
machinery/tools, electronics, and textiles. Birmingham, AL, is the opposite. There, relatively high-value
chemicals/plastics are not enough to compensate for trade in lower-value metals and agricultural
products.<br><br>
Although average values are an important measure of the composition and focus of a metro area’s
industries, they are not an indicator of economic growth patterns. Table 2 shows that Hartford, CT,
Providence, RI, and Bridgeport, CT, trade some of the country’s most valuable goods. However, they
are among the slowest to recover from the recession in the nation. Just because a metro produces
high-value goods, does not mean either those industries are growing or, if they are growing, they
can offset slower growth rates in other local industries. Interestingly, many metro areas that trade
lower-value goods are experiencing much stronger economic recoveries. Houston and New Orleans
are notable in this respect, moving some of the least valuable goods while ranking in the top 10 metro
areas on the basis of their recoveries.45<br><br>

<a href= "pic08.html">Metropolitan Goods</a><br><br>

The majority of goods traded in the largest metropolitan areas are traded in the domestic marketplace.
Within each of the largest metro areas, domestic trade represents at least two-thirds of total
trade. Table 3 shows that some metro areas such as Stockton, CA, Modesto, CA, and Lancaster, PA,
along with seven others, all conduct more than 90 percent of their trade within the United States.
These 10 markets still trade globally―$60.0 billion, which is more than Pakistan’s total international
trade―but these volumes are miniscule compared with the $731.9 billion they trade domestically.52<br><br>
While domestic trade constitutes a majority of the goods U.S. metro areas exchange, increased trade
with global metro areas remains paramount to boosting U.S. economic health and competitiveness.<br><br>
Exports have driven more than one-half of the growth in economic output since the recession ended.53<br><br>
With more than 95 percent of the world’s consumers projected to be outside the United States in the
coming decade, as well as 80 percent of global economic growth, many U.S. metro areas are moving
aggressively to capitalize on this opportunity.<br><br>

<a href= "pic09.html">Top 10 Domestic and International Trade</a><br><br>

Between 1990 and 2010, U.S. international trade volumes increased by more than 250 percent
in inflation-adjusted terms, far surpassing the rate of increase in domestic economic growth.54<br><br>
International goods trade now exceeds $3.0 trillion in value and 1.8 billion tons in weight.55 As value
chains continue to extend across the globe, and emerging countries continue to increase their demand
for U.S. goods, it is reasonable to expect these volumes and shares will to continue to grow. Today, 15
percent of total U.S. goods trade is international by value and 10 percent by weight.56<br><br>
<a href= "pic10.html">Figure 3. Total Goods Trade Volumes and International Share, 100 Metropolitan Areas, 2010</a><br><br>
The 100 largest metro areas are responsible for the vast majority of the nation’s international trade,
over 63 percent, as well as the highest valued trades. International goods in these metro areas are
typically worth $1,934 per ton, exceeding the average value of international goods in non-metropolitan
areas ($1,125 per ton) by 72 percent and other metropolitan areas ($1,557 per ton) by 24 percent. In 84
of the 100 metro areas, internationally traded goods carried a higher average value than domestically
traded goods.<br><br>
With a propensity to trade more valuable commodities, the 100 largest metro areas have a clear
advantage in trading high-end goods. Internationally, in particular, they trade the majority of the
nation’s most valuable commodities: precision instruments (77 percent); electronics (74 percent);
machinery/tools (63 percent); and transportation equipment (61 percent).57<br><br>
A handful of metropolitan areas are also heavily oriented toward international trade overall. In 39
of the 100 largest metro areas, the international share of goods trade exceeds the national average
(Figure 3). These metro areas range from large international traders such as New York, Houston, and
San Jose―all of which rank in the top five by total international volume―to smaller metro areas such
as Jackson, MS, Honolulu, HI, and Tulsa, OK, which have relatively low trade volumes despite being
more globally oriented than the rest of the country. Although not necessarily easy, metro areas looking
to expand their international presence should take note of their unique local industrial traits and
network with peers that already trade at higher shares in the international space.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T7">Houston: Leveraging its Energy Advantage</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
With the nation’s fifth highest GDP, metropolitan Houston draws approximately one-third of its output from industries that
produce physical goods. That is the highest total ($112.5 billion in 2010) among all metro areas and is driven by commodities
such as energy, chemicals, and machinery.37<br><br>
Transporting $511.9 billion in freight, Houston ranks behind only New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago in total goods volume.
Combined, energy products and chemicals/plastics account for more than half its total, while electronics and machinery/tools
contribute another 20 percent. Houston’s dominance in energy and chemicals, ranging from refined gasoline to plastics and rubber,
is fueled by several prominent firms headquartered nearby, such as ConocoPhillips and Marathon Oil, and more than 3,700
energy-related establishments.38 As a result, Houston’s trade in energy products ($164.7 billion) is higher than any other metro
area, and more than double the next largest energy trader, Los Angeles ($79.6 billion.)
Houston’s specialization in energy and manufacturing is even more remarkable in terms of weight, as it transports the most
tonnage nationally (539 million tons in 2010), more than New Orleans and Dallas combined. Once again, energy products lead all
other goods―accounting for 63 percent of the metro total―followed by chemicals/plastics. As local refineries attract higher volumes
of oil and natural gas following the recent shale gas boom, Houston is expected to expand its comparative advantage in the
energy sector in coming years.39 The Port of Houston, likewise, is experiencing a surge in business centered on this movement,
spurring additional investment throughout the area to handle more of this heavy freight.40<br><br>
Although metropolitan Houston moves 76 percent of its goods domestically, its concentration in energy production and consumption
means it is more globally oriented than other metro areas. Next to electronics, energy products make up the second
highest international share―roughly 35 percent by value and weight―among all commodities in the metro area. Houston imports
significantly more of these energy commodities than it exports, but those commodities serve as essential inputs for the oil it
refines and the chemicals it produces for other markets. Indeed, by building off its energy sector, Houston has grown into a leading
exporter of several goods, a position it aims to further strengthen through its international connections.41<br><br>

	<b><a name="T8">San Jose: Specializing in High-Value Goods</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Known as the “Capital of Silicon Valley,” metropolitan San Jose is the center of the nation’s
high-tech hub, and goods-producing tech industries contribute to more than 31 percent
($39.7 billion) of the metro area’s total output.46 The large volume of electronics, precision
instruments, and other advanced industrial products make San Jose one of the country’s chief
engines of high-value commodity trading.<br><br>
Trade volumes in electronics amount to $102.0 billion, second only to metropolitan Los Angeles
($104.7 billion), and represent 49 percent of San Jose’s total goods trade, an enormous concentration
in a single category and its associated industries. From Google and Apple to Hewlett-Packard
and Cisco Systems, the cluster of high-tech firms and production facilities near San Jose magnifies
the importance of computers, networking equipment, and other electronic components
transported to and from the area.47 San Jose also specializes in trading complementary goods,
including machinery/tools ($29.5 billion) and precision instruments ($16.0 billion), ranking closely
behind Boston in both commodities.<br><br>
With a focus on advanced industries, metropolitan San Jose is a national center in high-value
goods trading. The average good in San Jose trades for more than $3,000 per ton, which exceeds
other major electronic production centers such as Phoenix ($2,460) and Austin, TX ($1,990).48
Even more notable is the fact that San Jose sends out goods worth about $1,550 more, on
average, than what it takes in, highlighting its ability to create value on a range of products.
Electronics leaving the metro area, for instance, have an average value ($29,120), considerably
higher than those that enter it ($24,340). This is likely owing to the area’s concentration in
advanced manufacturing operations.49<br><br>
San Jose’s metropolitan economy is buoyed by its firms’ strong connections to global production
networks.50 For example, while San Jose ranks 12th among the 100 largest metro areas in the
average value of its domestic goods ($2,190), it is unrivaled in the value of its international goods
($9,420), which are worth almost double those in the next highest metro, Palm Bay, FL ($5,250).<br><br>
Among these international goods, San Jose is the country’s foremost exporter of electronics, with
a volume ($25.9 billion)that is more than three times as high as that of the next ranking metro
area, Dallas ($8.2 billion), reaffirming its status as a globally fluent metro.51<br><br>
Beyond increased production, advances in technology and manufacturing benefit the high-tech
industries that generate a majority of the area’s trade in goods. At the same time, the steady
stream of start-ups and skilled entrepreneurs entering the region cement San Jose’s leading role
in global value chains, driving trade in the most valuable goods worldwide.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T9">From Tucson to Atlanta: A Measure of Trading Specialization</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
How can metro areas determine whether they are a specialized or balanced trader? One method to determine “specialization”
is a combination of location quotients (LQs) and standard deviations (SD). LQs are a way to measure how a commodity’s
share of metropolitan trade volumes relates to the national average: if it is higher than average, the LQ exceeds 1. The
higher the standard deviation in LQ, the more specialized a particular metro is in trading one or more particular goods.<br><br>
The most specialized trader is Tucson, whose major commodity is stones/ores. Tucson’s mining-related trade, which ranges
from operating mines to the city’s annual gem show, makes up 8.8 percent of the metro area’s total traded value, far exceeding
the national average of 0.4 percent. These trade levels point to an enormous mining industry, whose share of metro GDP is
larger in Tucson that it is in any other metro area in the country.58 On the other end, Tucson trades at below-average levels in
many other commodities, including energy products, agricultural products, and transportation equipment. Other metro areas with
specializations in low-value commodities include Salt Lake City (stones/ores), New Orleans (energy products), and Youngstown,
OH (metals).<br><br>
Other highly specialized markets focus on more valuable products. Metropolitan Austin is a prime example with a 4.96 LQ in
electronics but below-average shares in other high-value commodities such as textiles, transportation equipment, and machinery/
tools. Not only do major firms such as Dell help Austin move large volumes of electronic goods, but they also drive Austin’s
innovation-rich economy.59 Other metro areas with a specialization in high-value commodities include Detroit (transportation
equipment), Greensboro, NC (furniture), and Palm Bay, FL (precision instruments).<br><br>
The most balanced traders, by comparison, are large, diverse economies: Chicago, Philadelphia, and Atlanta. Each metro area
has one commodity with an LQ above 1.25―metals in Chicago, textiles in Philadelphia, and chemicals/plastics in Atlanta―but these
three metro economies are also involved in a wide range of production and consumption activities. Other metro areas with balanced
trading profiles are Dallas, San Antonio, and Jacksonville, FL.<br><br>
These metrics can serve as warnings to metro areas in need of firm or industrial diversification. For example, what would happen
to New Orleans’ economy and trading patterns if a major oil-related firm like Tidewater, Inc., moved elsewhere along the Gulf
Coast, or if Dell moved out of Austin? Is there a big enough industry cluster to compensate for such losses, or the potential to
build other industries that would become the metro’s new trading anchors? These questions are for local leaders to answer―but
trading specialization statistics help reveal which markets should consider them.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T10">V. Metropolitan Trade Balances</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
The “national trade balance” in goods and services is a familiar economic measure. Media
outlets regularly report the difference between exports (considered positive) and imports
(considered negative.) In this way, the U.S. runs an international goods trade deficit that is
easily the world’s largest, far exceeding the second-largest out of the United Kingdom.60<br><br>
While these accounts are important and can highlight which commodities contribute most to the
national deficit, they cannot indicate which metropolitan areas actually trade those products both
internationally and within American borders.61<br><br>
In short, national trade balances fail to capture the economic variability in a country as big as
the U.S.
This section analyzes metropolitan trade balances. It identifies which areas of the country generate
surpluses and deficits, and which commodities trend towards each side of the balance ledger. In the
process, it adds nuance to more traditional national goods trade measures.<br><br>
In considering these new metropolitan trade balances, it is important to understand that not all
commodities are meant to be sold at a surplus, particularly for many land-intensive natural resources.
Geography-centered trade and commodity theories, such as the Von Thünen model to the new economic
geography, made popular through Paul Krugman’s work, all suggest large population centers
rely on less-populated areas to satisfy many of their natural resources demands.62<br><br>
In particular, the 100 largest metro areas frequently purchase greater amounts of commodities
such as textiles, agricultural, and wood products than they sell. Relative to their outflows, these large
inflows are to be expected for the simple fact that they serve as the critical inputs to sustain advanced
metro economies.<br><br>

The largest net inflow ($237.4 billion) is in energy products―including coal, crude petroleum, refined
oils, and liquid natural gas―given what major metro areas require to power homes, factories, and most
every element of their built environment. More than one-half of this energy deficit―$160.8 billion―is in
international trade. This is one reason why the U.S. shale gas boom can have a sizable impact on international
capital flows and why metro areas’ continued investments in local renewable energy sources
can create more energy self-sufficiency.<br><br>
In contrast, the 100 largest metro areas export more advanced industry (AI) commodities than they
import. They trade the five AI commodities―chemicals/plastics, machinery/tools, electronics, transportation
equipment, and precision instruments―at a $52 billion surplus (both domestic and international).
In fact, across all five AI commodities, 47 metro areas generate an overall surplus, moving out more
of these goods than they take in. Los Angeles is the clear leader, with an aggregate AI trade surplus
of $72.2 billion stemming from its diversified AI economy. Los Angeles’ manufacturing base generates
a $10 billion trade surplus in four of the five commodities. Five other metro areas exceed $20 billion
in AI surplus: Chicago ($44 billion), Houston ($32 billion), Memphis ($27.2 billion), Minneapolis ($22.6
billion), and New York ($20.8 billion).<br><br>
Another 34 metro areas run a surplus in at least one of the five AI commodities, including some
of the biggest single commodity surpluses (Table 4). For example, Seattle’s surplus of $9.5 billion in
transportation equipment reflects its aerospace specialty, often symbolized by Boeing’s local operations.
Philadelphia and Phoenix each create more than $4 billion in net value in machinery/tools and
electronics, respectively.<br><br>
These AI balances point to global economic opportunities for U.S. metro areas. Domestic AI surpluses
prove the strength of the U.S. marketplace, in that metro areas are developed enough to afford
the related industries’ expensive products. As the planet’s emerging economies continue to grow, their
increased incomes and advancing economic development cycles will make domestic AI products more
attractive. Just as important, domestic surpluses prove that U.S. metro areas already possess the
manufacturing foundation to meet increasing global AI demands.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T11">Chicago: Achieving Balanced Trade through Advanced Industries</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
A traditional Midwest powerhouse of production, metropolitan Chicago is home to a variety
of industries and infrastructure assets that connect it to the global marketplace. Although
Chicago serves as an international center of finance and commerce, the metropolitan area
maintains strength in advanced manufacturing and freight coordination, developing a co-location
that helps contribute more than$65 billion annually to its gross regional product.63 The proximity
of factories, ports, warehouses, rail lines, and related establishments gives Chicago a strategic
advantage during the production process, making it easier to add value through specialization,
benefit from a large labor pool, and directly access other markets.64 With a focus in machinery,
metals, and chemicals, Chicago operates at an enormous scale of production and is relatively balanced
in its goods trade.<br><br>
Unlike other metro areas that move large volumes of freight and have significantly higher
inflows than outflows―such as New York, Atlanta, and Phoenix―Chicago sells almost as much as
it purchases externally. Chemicals, particularly pharmaceuticals, are its lead commodity in this
respect, with a $31.5 billion surplus, followed by metals ($12.1 billion), machinery/tools ($6.7 billion),
and transportation equipment ($5.8 billion). Its surplus in all four goods ranks in the top 10 metro
areas nationally, neck-in-neck with industrial hubs such as Houston in chemicals ($33.9 billion) and
Pittsburgh in metals ($12.5 billion). Indeed, its diversity in business, represented by such firms as
Illinois Tool Works, Abbott Laboratories, and Navistar International, solidifies the area’s standing
as a global economic force and heightens its appeal to customers beyond its borders.65<br><br>
To fuel this production and sustain its population, Chicago takes in a broad range of commodities,
from energy products to textiles and agriculture. This dependence mirrors metro areas like
Los Angeles and Philadelphia that must absorb the necessary consumer products for survival and
intermediate inputs for value creation. In much the same way, Chicago’s role in global value chains
becomes increasingly clear through the massive amount of heavy goods it moves in versus those
that it moves out. For example, by bringing in more fuel oils, metallic ores, and wood products than
it sends out, Chicago is able to burn, refine, and transform these heavy, raw goods into more valuable
finished products.<br><br>
Domestically, Chicago maintains the fifth highest trade surplus ($25.3 billion) among all metro
areas, largely driven by its specialties in chemicals and metals. Internationally, it mostly relies on
energy and electronic imports to propel this economic growth, similar to many other metro areas.
Moreover, to facilitate the movement of all these goods, Chicago’s numerous railroads, highways,
and ports―led by O’Hare and Midway International Airports―promote its international accessibility
and add to its global fluency.66<br><br>
Through efforts such as Retrofit Chicago, policymakers have taken additional steps to further
the metro area’s competiveness in global value chains. Efforts are underway to promote the area’s
energy efficiency and seek alternative energy sources.67 At the same time, policymakers remain
steadfast in their commitment to boost exports.68 Investments in advanced manufacturing are
critical to this strategy, which can help complement one of the major commodities―precision
instruments―in which Chicago has an international surplus.69<br><br>
Chicago is well-positioned for global goods trade as it continues to leverage its vast number of
productive industries. Remaining a primary freight hub for transporting large volumes of goods,
the foundation is set for the metro area to strengthen its existing domestic connections and
expand its international trade through export-led growth.<br><br>

<a href= "pic11.html">Largest Surpluses in Advanced Industry-Related Commodities</a><br><br>
Given the variety of their economic specialties, 87 of the 100 metropolitan areas also run a trade
surplus in at least two other types of commodities (Table 5).70 For example, Fresno, CA, is well known
for its Central Valley agriculture and registers a $4.1 billion surplus in agricultural products. But Fresno
also has a positive trade balance in textiles ($2.4 billion) and mixed freight ($2.4 billion), underscoring
its industrial diversity. Buffalo, NY, conducts major surplus trade in metals ($3.1 billion) and energy and
agricultural products ($1.8 and $1.3 billion, respectively). Grand Rapids, MI, has one of the country’s biggest
surpluses in furniture ($2.3 billion) and also trades wood products at a surplus ($0.9 billion).<br><br>
Even a surplus in only one commodity is important. Omaha’s $5.6 billion surplus in agricultural products,
for instance, represents a major source of local value creation and jobs. Charleston, SC, likewise,
has a $2.6 billion surplus in metals. Surprisingly, among the 11 metros that have just one surplus commodity,
waste/scrap represents the good that most commonly brings new value into these areas. While
‘waste’ may conjure images of landfills, these surpluses are derived from the valuable byproducts of
industrial processes, including scrap metal, paper, and glass.71<br><br>
Table 5 shows that among other non-AI commodities, several metro areas produce a surplus in
“mixed freight,” which includes a range of wholesale and retail items, such as food, hardware, and office
supplies.72 Major distribution centers, including Dallas and Memphis, are among the leading metro areas
in this commodity.73 Some areas also benefit from large wholesale operations linked to particular firms
or markets; Lancaster and Allentown, PA, for instance, are ideally situated near Philadelphia and New
York. The location of the metros specializing in mixed freight trade has significant implications for the
logistics industry and for freight planning, which will be addressed in future reports.<br><br>
Some metro areas have trade surpluses in both AI and other commodities. Metropolitan Los
Angeles, for example, has trade surpluses in textiles ($13.5 billion) and in all five AI industries, as does
Indianapolis, which is one of the few large metro areas with a surplus in wood products ($2.2 billion) to
join its large surplus ($2.5 billion) in precision instruments. Pittsburgh generates a $12.5 billion surplus
in metals. Yet it also has started to expand its high-tech sector, with important contributions from local
anchor institutions such as Carnegie Mellon.74 In part as a result, Pittsburgh now generates a $0.4 billion
surplus in precision instruments.<br><br>
Finally, it’s worth addressing a critical question: how do metropolitan areas offset trade deficits in
particular commodities? Some metro areas use their surpluses in other traded goods to pay for these
products, but they also use tradable services. These include a range of occupations, from financiers
and product designers to hotel managers and professional athletes. When service firms and workers
sell their products to outside markets, they bring new income to a metropolitan area. The United States
already runs an international surplus in tradable services―primarily driven by services exported from
the 100 largest metropolitan areas―and there is every reason to believe the same is occurring on the
domestic side.75 These services help fund inflows, and in some places may be enough to offset local
goods deficits. Unfortunately, there are no metro measures for services trade.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T12">Washington, D.C.: Generating a Goods Trade Surplus in Only Garbage</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
As the nation’s capital, metropolitan Washington contains a unique mix of public- and privatesector
firms that add economic value through knowledge, innovation, and high levels of
human capital.76 In fact, service industries account for more than 95 percent of the metro
area’s total output, second only to Honolulu.77 In addition to government, Washington is a hub
for research and development, technology, and tourism as well as the nation’s fourth-largest
economy.78 Goods trade helps fuel these service activities, connecting Washington to global value
chains as a major goods consumer.<br><br>
Metropolitan Washington takes in $85.8 billion more goods than it sends out. It must bring in
not only enough food and energy to satisfy its large and growing population, but also enough
electronics and machinery to equip firms such as Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics, and AES
Corporation.79<br><br>
With an extensive service base and a relatively smaller core of goods-producing industries,
Washington serves as a key destination for freight. While it ranks 10th in total inflows ($127.6 billion)
among the 100 largest metro areas, comparable to Miami and San Francisco, it ranks just 47th
in total outflows ($41.8 billion), on par with Oxnard, CA, and Dayton, OH. Although Washington has
almost $8.8 billion in outflows of electronics―supported by its concentration of information and
communication technology companies―its inflows are $16.8 billion.80 The same proves true for
chemicals/plastics and machinery/tools, where it simply does not create enough excess production
for widespread distribution elsewhere. Of all commodities, only waste produces a trade surplus
($0.5 billion).<br><br>
Washington’s reliance on external markets is clear. The only metro areas that come close to
such lopsided proportions are Cape Coral, FL, Honolulu, and Las Vegas. Washington relies heavily
on domestic agricultural products, machinery/tools, and goods typically sold in retail stores (categorized
here as “mixed freight). It also imports many similar goods from international markets,
including textiles, to support the daily rhythm of its households and firms.<br><br>
In this way, Washington’s service-based economy depends on global goods trade to operate,
even though it primarily functions as a consumer rather than a producer. In stark contrast to
industrial hubs like Houston and Portland, Washington does not have many surplus goods to
distribute beyond its borders, except waste. However, that deficit should not diminish the metro
area’s importance in global value chains, as it adds value in ways beyond physical production
through its many service activities.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T13">Non-metropolitan Areas: Supplying and Moving America’s Critical Commodities</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
As the nation’s primary freight hubs, metropolitan areas depend on raw materials sourced
and shipped from their hinterlands.81 Non-metropolitan areas, stretching from the cornfields
of Nebraska and oilfields of Texas to the silver mines of Nevada and stone quarries
of Pennsylvania, grow the ingredients and extract the resources that serve as the backbone for
global value chains.<br><br>
Although non-metropolitan regions move $3.7 trillion of goods, they specialize in heavier goods.
Energy and agricultural products compose nearly two-thirds of their commodities, followed by
stones/ores (573 million tons), chemicals/plastics (334 million tons), and wood products (331 million
tons). These goods, in many ways, are the building blocks for advanced metro economies.<br><br>
Certain regions are very active in the energy and agricultural sectors. The non-metropolitan
parts of Iowa and Illinois cultivate the most agricultural goods (235 million tons in total) through
their large-scale farming operations, while Wyoming moves the most energy products (502 million
tons), drawing from the rich coal deposits in the Powder River Basin. In fact, the amount of energy
moved to and from Wyoming is so great that it helps to power one out of every five homes and
businesses in the United States.82<br><br>
This specialization in raw commodities means non-metropolitan regions transport goods with
an average value ($680 per ton) less than half that of the 100 largest metro areas ($1,563 per
ton). Although several areas transport goods worth considerably more―including areas of New
Hampshire that move valuable electronics and precision instruments as part of the state’s growing
high-tech sector―others concentrate on moving bulk goods and natural resources found locally.83<br><br>
Non-metropolitan regions, as such, tend to gravitate toward domestic trade. The goods from
non-metropolitan regions in Colorado, Utah, and New Mexico, for instance, are almost all traded
domestically as they mine the heavy stones/ores and energy products prevalent in the Mountain
West.84 Non-metropolitan regions of Washington and Oregon are among only a few areas with
international shares higher than 10 percent, exporting many agricultural and wood products.<br><br>
Through their various goods, non-metropolitan regions provide metro areas with the needed
inputs to add value and generate output. They provide the food, energy, and raw supplies that
enable metro areas to function in an increasingly competitive global trade network. Even as the
U.S. economy focuses more on exporting high-value goods and services, non-metropolitan regions
remain significant, allowing for greater metropolitan specialization and supporting U.S. global
goods trade.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T14">VI. Issues and Implications</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Metropolitan trade is endemic in modern economies. Regions with concentrated assets
depend on other areas for both production and consumption of the goods they trade.
In the end, these intricate relationships enable modern global economies to grow.<br><br>
Although these relationships are still not well understood, the statistics in this report
begin to explore new dimensions to goods trade and point to implications for metropolitan leaders.
Those implications include the following:<br><br>
Metro leaders can use these documented trade volumes and balances to better understand
their economic starting point.<br><br>
The trading patterns in metro areas reflect their specialization in goods and services production.<br><br>
This report enables metro leaders to better understand their distinctive strengths in what and where
they trade, and how that trade relates to their regional peers.85 Significantly, this research shows that
advanced industries represent the kind of globally competitive products that can maximize internationally
exported value. Just as important, the chief assets to build those industries are located within
the country’s largest metropolitan areas.<br><br>

Advanced industries employ a highly skilled workforce and through intense research and development
represent the core sites of technological innovation in the United States. They make the kind of
products that simply did not exist a century ago, from lithium-ion batteries and high-end pharmaceuticals
to satellite equipment. Advanced industries compose more than 11 percent of the overall economy,
generate 45 percent of U.S. goods exports, and support more than 4 million high-skilled jobs, along
with several million more ancillary jobs.86 These industries cannot exist in just any location. They
require a sensitive mix of labor, equipment, and investment to make their product designs a reality.<br><br>
This makes advanced economies like the United States―with a well-educated population, efficient and
well-connected trade infrastructure, and deep financial markets―the ideal locations for these modern
industries.87<br><br>
This research shows that the 100 largest metro areas already trade a majority of the value of the
commodities that advanced industries are most likely to manufacture: precision instruments (73
percent), electronics (71 percent), chemicals/plastics (63 percent), machinery/tools (61 percent), and
transportation equipment (60 percent). The AI strengths in electronics and precision instruments in
metro areas such as Austin, San Jose, and Boston are well known. This report also points to similar,
albeit smaller, positive trading relationships in metro areas such as Nashville, Oxnard, Boise, and
Poughkeepsie. These AI markets enjoy advantages of an educated workforce, venture capital funding,
the presence of research universities, and critical transportation assets. These advantages also
include the labor, physical, and financial assets needed to expand that manufacturing base even
further.<br><br>
Trading AI products requires more than just the physical creation of products. Manufacturing those
products depends on related service occupations staffed with a well-educated workforce. Those tasks
range from initial product designs to the financing of facility investments and to marketing and sales.
Goods trade data do not capture this service side of value creation. The geography of these service
impacts requires further investigation. Understanding how firms cluster across multiple industrial sectors―
or do not cluster―will help lead to a better understanding of metropolitan supply chains, and the
complete value derived from goods trade.<br><br>
Not every metro area specializes in AI sectors. The positive trade balances in metro areas such
as Omaha (agriculture), Tucson (stones/ores), Augusta, GA, (wood products), and Greensboro, NC
(textiles) also reveal unique assets metro leaders should continue to maintain. Fortunately, each
metro area does enjoy a trade surplus in at least one commodity, and usually more than one. Leaders
in every metro area should know what their surplus goods sectors are and build on these distinctive
strengths.<br><br>
Metro leaders should integrate goods movement into their broader transportation and
economic development programs, particularly with regard to exports, and draw on the
innovative practices of other metro areas in doing so.<br><br>
Portland and Minneapolis are among a handful of metro areas already advancing their own dynamic
freight plans as a way to maximize economic development. These places have forged a new path,
expanding freight’s scope beyond individual transportation modes and establishing a policy framework
based on freight’s economic impacts. A new understanding of metro trade volumes and balances
should augment these plans.<br><br>
Portland’s freight plan draws from the region’s history as a northwestern freight hub and aims to
strengthen its position in global value chains.88 Portland assesses freight needs in light of its overarching
economic priorities by identifying the infrastructure assets that facilitate this movement and
prioritizing improvements based on traffic from nearby industries. Through this approach, Portland’s
leaders reinforce trade’s fundamental link to the metropolitan economy and explore ways to spur
additional output, job growth, and exports.89 The newly formed Greater Portland Export Plan adds
even more momentum by outlining strategies to leverage the region’s trade specialization in high-end
electronics by strengthening supply chain relationships abroad.90<br><br>
Minneapolis pursued a similar freight strategy by focusing on the long-term efficiency and reliability
of infrastructure to service its goods trade. The Twin Cities Metropolitan Area Freight Initiative emphasizes
stronger partnerships with private-sector firms, including new institutional arrangements to
promote better freight cooperation.91 Other objectives include an evaluation of existing transportation

plans, a comparison of best practices among peer cities, and the development of performance measures
for freight projects. Other economic plans, including the Minneapolis-Saint Paul Export Plan
developed in 2012, draw guidance from this strategy and aim to extend the metro’s reach to global
markets.92<br><br>
National and state plans should build off these metropolitan efforts to capture the importance of
freight in economic development. Declining infrastructure means that a highway bottleneck, congested
railway interchange, or deteriorating inland waterway halfway across the country can easily
impact local economies. This creates an incentive for all metro areas to not only understand their network
of trading partners, but also to collaborate or support freight investments beyond their borders.<br><br>
It also shows why national-level corridor investments―like the Heartland rail corridor and Mississippi
River investments―have the power to benefit all markets.<br><br>
Ultimately, all metro leaders―and national policymakers―must better understand the quality and
purpose of the nation’s freight networks. Forthcoming research in this series will focus on specific
freight modes (e.g., roads, rails, ports, and pipes).<br><br>
Metro area leaders should build networks of firms, institutions, and individuals from
existing and potential trading partners.<br><br>
While specific firms and logistics companies may understand their domestic networks and specific
global connections, metro leaders must also recognize the new orientation of global production and
trade.<br><br>
Entire production processes now rarely take place in one single region, or even within one country.
Commodity chains now extend across the world, relying on particular countries and their metropolitan
regions to provide commodities at the highest quality for the lowest price. A firm may design a
product in an American office building, order products from advanced manufacturing plants elsewhere
in the United States and Europe, ship the products to Asia for final assembly, and then distribute the
final consumer product to markets all around the world.<br><br>
The new information in this report demonstrates the global orientation of each metro area. It shows
that large metros like New York, Houston, and Los Angeles exchange massive amounts of goods with
the rest of the world. It also shows that other metros with a relatively large share of their trade that is
international―like Bridgeport (precision instruments), Palm Bay (electronics), and Wichita (transportation
equipment)―also have a significant global orientation.<br><br>
Many of the metro areas with the strongest concentrations of trade in the domestic marketplaces
hould take steps to become more globally fluent. Reorienting their goods trade is neither quick nor
easy and large macroeconomic forces in the global economy are beyond the control of most metro
areas.93 But other metro areas, such as Syracuse, where 91 percent of goods trade is domestic, have
positive overall trading balances in commodities like metals, machinery/tools, and precision instruments.
That region is engaged in a deliberate effort to double exports through a range of strategies
that support existing exporters while cultivating new ones.94<br><br>
In many ways, this report only scratches the surface of what metropolitan trade networks can
uncover. Further research will provide details on the precise trading relationships between metro
areas both within the United States and around the world.<br><br>

	<hr><br>
	
Metropolitan areas are the primary drivers of global goods trade, moving an enormous
amount of freight to spur economic growth. With access to markets far beyond their
borders, they exchange a variety of goods to function locally and to compete globally
in trade networks that now touch every corner of the world. The 100 largest metropolitan
areas moved 7.8 billion tons of freight worth more than $12.2 trillion in 2010 alone, surpassing all
other regions nationally and signaling the importance of goods trade to the American economy.<br><br>
By focusing on domestic and international freight movement, this report is the first to examine
goods trade at a metropolitan scale. Offering a new way to visualize freight movement, it highlights
the crucial role played by metropolitan goods trade within the United States and abroad, in terms of


both the volume and balance of this trade. In doing so, it helps reveal the tight interrelationship among
metro economies within larger global value chains and addresses a shortcoming of national-level trade
statistics.<br><br>
We hope this work engages a group of innovative thinkers, practitioners, and policymakers. Armed
with this new knowledge, metropolitan leaders can better understand their economic starting point
in goods trade. They can gain a clearer picture of how their local economies move different types of
goods, which can help guide investments in industries essential to these movements. At the same
time, they can begin to see how their economies connect to other markets in different ways and what
these relationships hold for future development strategies. Forging stronger networks to support this
trade, moreover, can benefit all metropolitan areas as they address their collective needs.<br><br>

Goods Trade Database<br><br>
This report uses a unique database measuring goods traded among: U.S. metropolitan areas, nonmetropolitan
regions, and international geographies. We used the data foundation and design scheme
of the publicly available Freight Analysis Framework (FAF), Version 3.2. The U.S. Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA) constructed the database with the help of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory
(ORNL).95 The database provides a comprehensive view of freight movement to, from, and within the
United States. Based on calendar year 2007, version 3.2 has been provisionally updated to estimate
2010 total freight volumes, or flows, by annual tonnage, value, and ton-mileage.<br><br>
FAF estimates and assigns these flows through a matrix based on the shipment origin (O), shipment
destination (D), commodity being transported (C), and mode used (M). To build this matrix and
model freight movement, FAF draws from multiple data sources, but is principally derived from the
Commodity Flow Survey (CFS), which is conducted every five years through a partnership between
the U.S. Census Bureau and the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) as part of the Economic
Census.96 The CFS is a shipper-based survey that tracks the number of tons and dollar value of goods
transported annually across all modes between different regions of the United States. However,
because the CFS excludes imports and collects limited data for several freight-related industries, FAF
uses a multi-step approach and additional data sources to estimate these “out-of-scope” flows.<br><br>
In total, the FAF matrix covers 131 geographic regions, 43 commodities, and seven transportation
modes. Geographically, FAF’s O-D movements span 123 domestic regions and eight world regions,
including 74 state-specific U.S. metropolitan areas, 33 state remainders, and 16 whole states.<br><br>
Metropolitan areas in FAF do not cross state lines, meaning metros are frequently divided into different
parts depending on the states located in their respective metropolitan statistical area. Kansas City,
for instance, is divided between two states (Missouri and Kansas). In addition, FAF does not follow a
single metropolitan geographic definition, and instead uses both Combined Statistical Area (CSA) and
Core Based Statistical Area (CBSA) definitions. For international flows, Canada, Mexico, and six groups
of multiple other countries are included and classified in the same way as statistical regions by the
United Nations.97 Despite FAF’s extensive spatial scope, it often lacks granularity for specific metro
areas and for even most country-level origins and destinations.<br><br>
FAF reports commodities at the Standard Classification of Transported Goods (SCTG) system’s twodigit
level. Collectively, there are 43, two-digit SCTG commodity codes, ranging from live animals and
fish (SCTG-01) to logs (SCTG-25) and mixed freight (SCTG-43). FAF relies on a variety of data sources
to estimate these commodity flows because many goods, including agricultural and petroleum products,
are concentrated in industries that fall outside the scope of the CFS.<br><br>
By partnering with Economic Development Research Group (EDR), we were able to modify FAF
to create a new database that identifies commodity flows with greater domestic and international
precision. Trade data from the World Institute for Strategic Economic Research (WISER), in addition to
industry data from IMPLAN and Moody’s Analytics, were particularly important to help model freight
movement in terms of local economic activity. While carrying out this work, we have also addressed
several gaps and discrepancies inherent in FAF.<br><br>

With an interest in showing domestic and international freight flows in, out, and among all of the
country’s metropolitan areas, we worked with EDR to estimate freight movement across combined statistical
areas (CBSAs). Because FAF zones and CBSAs have overlapping spatial coverage at the county
level, we first allocated FAF zone flows down to individual counties and then aggregated up to larger
CBSAs. To accomplish this task, we used appropriate production, consumption, and port flow data
when allocating totals―in both dollars and tonnage―to specific domestic origins and destinations.
Domestically, the estimation process varied slightly depending on the exact geography, mode, and
type of flow in question. For example, we assigned flows between two distinct metropolitan areas on
the basis of the magnitude of production and consumption in each area, while we used an additional
gravity constraint when estimating flows that involved large FAF zones, such as state remainders, to
match supply and demand over longer distances. A gravity constraint is a way to use distance, alongside
economic data, when determining trade flows between places.<br><br>
In all domestic regions, the process essentially followed three steps: (1) allocate the commodity supply
on the basis of the county share of industries producing this commodity; (2) allocate the commodity
demand on the basis of the county share of industries consuming this commodity; and (3) balance
the commodity production and attraction on the basis of modal availability. We then aggregated
these county commodity flows in turn to their respective CBSAs, while approximating the original FAF
aggregate totals for the particular commodity. We classified remaining flows not included in the CBSAs
under state remainders.<br><br>
Internationally, the estimation process relied more extensively on a gravity constraint to allocate
export and import flows, primarily because of commodity sourcing issues in FAF. Because FAF defines
international movement in two ways―separating the domestic and international legs―there was a statistical
concern regarding port-related metros over-assigned local production and consumption trade
flows. Miami, for instance, not only served as an enormous port for moving exports out of the country,
but FAF also recorded it as one of the largest producers (or origins) for these exports. Anchorage,
likewise, served as a primary port of entry for imports, but it designated as one of the largest consumers
(or final destinations) for these imports. Our new database, in contrast, used WISER trade data and
an additional gravity constraint to link the origin for exports and destination for imports more directly
in terms of patterns of economic production and consumption. The results are a relative match for
past Metropolitan Policy Program export research, sharing a 0.91 correlation with ExportNation’s 2010
goods data.98 However, because this report and ExportNation use different statistical bases, and only
ExportNation includes service exports, the actual numbers will not match between the two datasets.<br><br>
Among commodities that fall outside the scope of the CFS, crude petroleum (SCTG 16), in particular,
required additional attention. Limited by the sample size for this commodity―along with numerous
industry records suppressed for confidentiality―FAF relies on a variety of sources to estimate petroleum
flows by value and weight at the county level. To address such gaps, our database allocates these
missing flows to counties with non-suppressed refinery data.<br><br>
In summary, our new database uses the same database design as FAF but adds geographic granularity
and increased data certainty. It still includes all 43 two-digit SCTG commodities and seven
transportation modes.99 Geographically, the database now includes 361 metropolitan areas, 48 state
remainders, and 40 international geographies.100 Table A1 lists the specific countries, country groups,
and continental remainders.<br><br>

Finally, the database and report’s analytics are only an estimation of expected goods trade and
freight activity. While the CFS and FAF are based on an extensive survey of freight shippers, as are
EDR’s use of WISER’s international shipping information, even the best surveys may over- or understate
certain trade levels. Likewise, while EDR uses well-regarded gravity constraints and production
and consumption data, these data modifiers can miss certain trading relationships. For example, the
data modifiers have no method to purposely account for under-reported intrafirm trading relationships.
These pitfalls are no different from other survey-based statistical analyses, but they are worth
considering if certain trade levels or trading relationships appear off-base.<br><br>

Time Periods Covered<br><br>
Although FAF provides estimates of projected flows from 2007through 2040, we only include 2010
provisional data in our database. Given the constantly changing nature of freight movement and
other economic developments, it can be difficult to gauge these sudden―and sometimes lasting―fluctuations.<br><br>
Limitations and inconsistencies in existing freight data also make it challenging to track
potential changes over time nationally, internationally, and between metro areas, most notably since
FAF is the only subnational freight database and it precludes longitudinal comparisons. At the time of
production, 2010 FAF estimates were the most current and comprehensive data available, which we
adjusted to more precisely track commodity flows at the metropolitan scale. Future updates to our
database would prove useful in monitoring freight movement changes over time, especially as the
economy continues to emerge from the Great Recession.<br><br>
Intermetropolitan Flows versus Intrametropolitan Flows<br><br>
This particular report focuses on goods trade between metropolitan areas, meaning the geographic
origin and destination are always different places. However, there is also a significant share of goods
trade that occurs within metropolitan areas. An assessment of such intrametropolitan goods trade
would require a closer examination of several alternate trading dynamics and particular freight concerns.<br><br>
Value, Tonnage, and Value per Ton<br><br>
This report uses two primary units of measure to describe intermetropolitan freight movement: value
(in millions of dollars) and tonnage (in thousands of tons). In aggregate, both measures reveal how
much traded goods are worth and weigh across different origins and destinations.<br><br>
Value per ton offers another helpful way to interpret overall and commodity-specific movements.<br><br>
By dividing the total freight value by the total freight tonnage in a particular metro, we are able to
examine how the average value of goods varies across geographies. Depending on a metro area’s commodity
or industry specialization, for instance, the average value of its freight could differ markedly
even when compared with the average value observed in neighboring metro areas. The relative value
of its international goods, likewise, could range widely depending on the foreign origin and destination.<br><br>
Lastly, certain commodities, such as precision instruments, are consistently more valuable than other
commodities, regardless of their origin or destination.<br><br>
Trade Balances<br><br>
Measuring the balance of goods trade―subtracting a metro area’s total inflows from its total outflows―
represents a key analytical approach beyond simply examining trade volumes. In particular,
this approach allows us to identify metro areas as net consumers or producers of goods on the basis
of their trade patterns. It also helps overcome many of the “pass-through” issues in FAF, namely by
distinguishing those commodities that receive light value-add activities as they travel through a metro
area en-route to somewhere else, versus those goods that are produced or consumed locally.<br><br>
Trade balances are considered to be a deficit if inflows are larger than outflows and a surplus if
outflows are larger than inflows. This report includes trade balances across both value and weight
measures, and similarly divides trade balances across domestic, international, and total trade geography.<br><br>
Finally, within those balances, metro areas can have a surplus or deficit in individual commodities.<br><br>
Industry Connections and Commodity Groups<br><br>
Goods trade volume and balances offer a useful way to gauge the profile of a metropolitan economy.
By viewing commodities in light of the industries that “make” and “use” them, the following method
allows us to assess this underlying relationship.<br><br>
While partnering with EDR, we reviewed a series of input-output (I-O) tables, similar to those developed
by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA).101 As defined by BEA, output (or make) tables
show the production of commodities by industry, while input (or use/recipe) tables show the uses of
commodities by intermediate and final users. Put simply, output tables illustrate the types of goods
that different industries produce (in dollars), while input tables show the variety of goods used by
these industries (in dollars) to produce their final goods or services.102 Each industry, furthermore,

features a unique “make share” and “use share” for specific commodities. Make shares depict the
amount of a commodity that is produced per dollar of total output, and use shares depict the amount
of a commodity required to produce every dollar of total output. In the furniture manufacturing
industry, for instance, furniture products have a make share slightly less than 1, meaning that for every
dollar of the industry’s output, this commodity essentially represents the only final good produced.<br><br>
The same industry, though, commonly requires wood products to create this furniture, represented
by a use share of less than 0.3. In other words, the industry uses 30 cents worth of wood products to
create every dollar of output.<br><br>
For many industries, there is a direct 1:1 relationship for particular commodities based on their make
shares. Industries that specialize in automobile manufacturing, logging, or tobacco farming are among
those that typically produce only one type of commodity. In contrast, there is often a one-to-many
relationship for industries and commodities based on their use share, highlighting how industries
frequently use different input commodities to create their output goods. In most cases, SCTG commodities
such as base metals and machinery may account for only a fraction of a cent for every dollar
of production. These commodities, in turn, are used as inputs in hundreds of industries, ranging from
steel manufacturers to electronics manufacturers.<br><br>
With this background in mind, we analyzed the make-use shares for the 43 2-digit SCTG commodities
across EDR’s input-output matrix based on the North American Industry Classification System
(NAICS). To manage the many industries that made products falling under multiple commodity codes,
we created our own commodity classification system of 15 new commodity groups, shown in Table A2.
This created a cleaner crosswalk between NAICS economic output data and SCTG commodity codes.<br><br>
By doing so, we were able to clearly relate 107 “production-oriented” and 206 “service-oriented”
four-digit NAICS industries to one of the 15 commodity groups. In short, the 107 production-oriented
industries all had a make share for at least one commodity, while the remaining 206 service-oriented
industries did not have a make share for any commodity. As a result, we classified production-oriented
industries under 15 commodity groups, and created a 16th commodity group―for non-commodities―to
classify service-oriented industries. While these service-oriented industries did not produce any physical
goods, they did play an important role in using the 15 other commodities to provide their services,
as based on their use shares.<br><br>
After linking commodities with their respective NAICS industries in this way, we were able to gauge
how much production was linked to specific inputs and outputs across different metro areas. For
each metro area, we downloaded 2010 GDP data from Moody’s Analytics that applied to the four-digit
industries included in our crosswalk. We then calculated the relative amount of production associated
with each commodity on the basis of the industries linked to these goods, first in terms of output and
later in terms of input.<br><br>
There are two critical limitations to I-O tables and commodity crosswalks for this report’s analytical
approach. First, I-O tables do not capture household consumption patterns. Although I-O tables do
show how much food or energy an industry may consume, they do not reference how much households
may consume of similar products. In this sense, an I-O table cannot fully predict the aggregate
level of commodity consumption taking place in a particular geography. Second, this report relied on
a single I-O table for the entire country, and therefore does not capture variable industrial patterns by
metropolitan area. Firms within the same industry will vary in the value of their inputs and outputs,
meaning each metro should technically follow a unique I-O table based on their unique collection of
firms and industry quality. This omission from our commodity-economic comparison will affect the
results to an unknown degree and is an important area to improve in future research.<br><br>
