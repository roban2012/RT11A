	<b><a name="T2">INTRODUCTION</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>

Africa starts 2013 with hope and optimism. Africa has dropped its mantle as a “doomed continent” and has weathered several global economic crises fairly well. Today, the continent is a land of opportunity both for Africans and international investors. Many now see the region as “emerging Africa” because of the positive changes that have taken place and continue to take place across the continent.<br><br>
Africa has changed, moving from economic stagnation to above 5 percent GDP growth on average. The continent is now home to some of the fastest growing economies in the world: Ethiopia, Ghana, Mozambique and Tanzania. This growth has helped build a burgeoning middle class, which has created new markets for goods and services. Investors focused on tapping into these new markets in Africa are likely to find it easier to do business there than ever before as African governments are working to reduce transaction costs. In addition to growing consumer markets, African countries have discovered additional natural resources. If managed properly, these resources could help spur further economic growth and development for the region and improve the lives of millions.<br><br>
Such an optimistic outlook for the continent means that African and global policymakers must get ahead of the challenges and opportunities for an important year of decision-making. Since 2010, the Brookings Africa Growth Initiative

(AGI) has asked its scholars to assess the top priorities for Africa in the coming year. This year, AGI experts and colleagues have identified what they consider to be the key issues for 2013 and ways to leverage opportunities so that Africa can continue its “emerging” momentum. The following briefs in the Foresight Africa collection are meant to create a dialogue on what matters in Africa for 2013, and it is our hope that this dialogue will continue through the year.<br><br>
For Africa’s Youth, Jobs are Job One
John Page argues that Africa’s youth unemployment challenges encompass more than just a lack of jobs since African youth often have little access to good quality jobs. Page calls for reforms in employment policy, growth in agriculture and other industries, and better technical and vocational training.<br><br>
The Second Obama Administration Should Close Africa’s Energy Poverty Gap<br><br>
Todd Moss and Stephanie Majerowicz assess Africa’s lack of accessible electricity and propose that the Obama administration make addressing the continent’s energy gap its lasting legacy for Africa. They maintain that American commitment in Africa to reduce energy poverty will produce benefits for the U.S., African countries and the global economy.<br><br>

China’s New Leadership and Sino-Africa Relations
Yun Sun, Julius Agbor and Jessica Smith examine the recent senior leadership changes in the Chinese government and discuss the impacts of the new leadership on China-Africa foreign relations. From China’s side, strategies may not change dramatically. However, the authors suggest that African governments may have an evolving view of China’s sometimes unequal partnership.<br><br>
Kenya at a Tipping Point: The 2013 Presidential Election<br><br>
Mwangi S. Kimenyi discusses how the upcoming Kenyan elections are significant not only for Kenya, but also for Africa and the world. Kimenyi also analyzes the impact of the International Criminal Court indictment of likely presidential candidates in Kenya and the decentralization of the government on the electoral process.<br><br>
Discordant Development and Insecurity in Africa<br><br>
Richard Joseph contends that the recent conflict and insecurity in Africa is caused by “discordant development”―a juxtaposition of high growth and deepening poverty. Joseph considers the causes of discordant development and provides recommendations for how policymakers can begin tackling the issue in order to address broader issues of insecurity.<br><br>

Narrowing Africa’s Education Deficit<br><br>
Kevin Watkins emphasizes that despite recent gains, sub-Saharan Africa is experiencing a two-pronged learning crisis of quality and access, and offers policy recommendations for how African governments can deal with this problem.
Building Opportunities: Addressing Africa’s
Lack of Infrastructure<br><br>
John Mukum Mbaku analyzes past and present efforts to increase Africa’s infrastructure capacity in light of ambitious newly proposed construction on the continent. Mbaku identifies the need to advance innovative financing solutions to support a long-term infrastructure development strategy in Africa.<br><br>
More than Just Sending Money Home: Engaging the Diaspora as a Priority for Africa’s Development
Anne W. Kamau and Mwangi S. Kimenyi stress that Africa’s large diaspora is an underutilized source of investment, support and political pressure for the continent. Kamau and Kimenyi offer ways for African policymakers to better engage diaspora members in the year ahead.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T3">FOR AFRICA’S YOUTH, JOBS ARE JOB ONE</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
John Page, Senior Fellow, Africa Growth Initiative<br><br>

In 2013, Africa will reach the midpoint of the African Union’s (AU) “Youth Decade Plan of Action” (2009-2018). With almost 200 million people aged between 15 and 24, Africa has the youngest population in the world. In a majority of African countries, youth account for more than 20 percent of the population (African Development Bank [AfDB], 2012). In addition, the number of young people will double by 2045, offering the possibility of a demographic dividend, but only if they can be absorbed into productive employment.1<br><br>
The AU Action Plan calls for measures to reduce Africa’s rate of youth unemployment by 2 percent per annum. The reality, however, is that midway through the Youth Decade, Africa is not creating enough jobs to absorb the 10 million to 12 million young people entering its labor markets each year. Although the youth population constitutes about two-fifths of the continent’s working-age population, they make up three-fifths of the unemployed. It is clearly time for a “midterm review” of employment prospects for young Africans.<br><br>
Why Jobs are a Priority for Africa<br><br>
Unlike North Africa, sub-Saharan Africa seems, on the face of it, to be creating enough jobs for its growing labor force.<br><br>


In 2009, the overall unemployment rate in sub-Saharan Africa was about 6 percent compared with a global average of 5 percent. Youth unemployment was about double the overall unemployment rate, but is low by global standards. The ratio of youth to adult unemployment in sub-Saharan Africa is 1.9 compared to 2.7 worldwide (African Development Bank [AfDB], 2012).<br><br>
This is not because Africa is doing well at generating jobs for the youth population. It is because African countries with low unemployment tend to have large informal sectors. Young people find work, but not in places that pay good wages, develop skills or provide a measure of job security. With the exceptions of Botswana, Nigeria and South Africa―all of which have alarmingly high youth unemployment rates―less than one-fifth of Africa’s young workers find wage employment. <br><br>Over 70 percent of youth in the Republic of the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, Malawi, Mali, Rwanda, Senegal and Uganda are either self-employed or contributing to family work. Moreover, the region’s fastest growing economies―which include Ethiopia, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda―have the lowest employment intensity of growth (AfDB, 2012). Rapid growth has created few good jobs, pushing those seeking work into informal employment, self-employment and family labor. In 2011, 82 percent of African workers were working poor, compared to the world average of 39 percent (International Labor Organization [ILO], 2011). For the great majority of African young people, the “youth employment problem” is more about the quality of the job than the absence of a job.<br><br>
Improving African Labor Markets in 2013<br><br>
Seen from this perspective, while labor market reforms and active labor market policies can make a contribution to solving the youth employment problem, the greatest traction is likely to come from policies and public actions designed to accelerate the growth of “good” jobs. A new action plan―one that combines efforts to improve the employment prospects for young people with a strategy for job creation―is needed.<br><br>
Improving employment prospects<br><br>
In the short run, a number of interventions can be undertaken to improve the employment prospects of new labor force entrants. In Botswana, Nigeria and South Africa, as well as North Africa, pressures to address open unemployment among the youth population will remain high. Governments can target young workers in employment-intensive activities, such as tourism and construction, with programs that offer cash for work. Governments can also experiment with increasing budget allocations to labor-intensive public works. Public works programs provide good opportunities for young workers, particularly rural residents and people with low skills, to acquire initial work experience. For example, in Senegal, the Agence d’Execution des Travaux d’Interêt Public (AGETIP) trains unemployed youth who work temporarily on public infrastructure projects (roads, buildings, sanitation systems, etc.) and then move on to more permanent jobs (World Bank, 2008).<br><br>
In the medium term, improving employment prospects will depend on changing the existing institutional arrangements that raise the costs of hiring workers for formal sector employers. In some countries, labor regulations that set minimum wages, determine social insurance contributions and protect job security will need to be changed. For example, firm-level surveys indicate that the single greatest impediment to the more rapid growth of labor-intensive, outward-oriented manufacturing in South Africa is the high level of real wages relative to productivity levels. However, regulatory reform is not a magic bullet. Most econometric evidence suggests that even complete deregulation of the labor market would not be sufficient to absorb all of the unemployed into the formal sector without more robust growth.<br><br>
Building skills<br><br>
There is a severe mismatch between the skills of young African workers and those needed by employers. In most sub-Saharan African countries, about two-thirds of all young workers in the labor market―95 million people―lack the basic skills needed to be competitive in the labor force (World Bank, 2008). Perhaps the most urgent reform needed is to increase the emphasis on post-primary education. Africa faces a large and growing gap with other developing regions in both secondary and tertiary enrollments. Increasing access to and the quality of post-primary education will be costly and unpopular with Africa’s development partners―who remain transfixed by the Millennium Development Goal of universal primary education―but it will be essential (see also “Narrowing Africa’s Education Deficit” by Kevin Watkins in this collection).<br><br>
Changes in vocational and technical education are also needed. Africa’s skill development schemes are supply-driven and disconnected from the demands of the labor market (Adams, 2006). A more market-oriented approach could be achieved through the use of training vouchers that can be redeemed with accredited private sector training providers or through industry-led training centers. Job training programs are also more likely to be successful if they are part of a package that includes basic education, employment services and social services (World Bank, 2008).<br><br>
Boosting labor demand<br><br>
To create more good jobs, Africa needs more industry. While manufacturing is the industrial sector most closely associated with employment-intensive growth, there are also “industries without smokestacks” in agriculture and services that can create good jobs. However, despite two decades of solid growth, industry, tradable services and agro-industry are still a small share of African employment and output (Page, 2012). To solve the employment problem more private investment in industry―with and without smokestacks―is essential.<br><br>
Domestic private investment has remained at about 11 percent of GDP in Africa since 1990 (World Bank, 2012). This number is well below the level needed for rapid industrial growth. Efforts by African governments and donors to increase private investment have mainly focused on improving the “investment climate”―the regulatory, institutional and physical environment within which firms operate. The high costs of doing business in Africa have been well documented by the World Bank and the World Economic Forum.2 However, investment climate reforms alone are unlikely to be sufficient to boost investment in industry.<br><br>
Industry is lumpy in size, space and time, and, as the experience of “factory Asia” has shown, once a critical mass of investment is reached, industrial growth can be explosive. Below critical mass, however, incremental changes in policies and institutions―the centerpiece of investment climate reform―may not be sufficient to spur rapid growth of industry and jobs. To boost investment, Africa’s economies need an industrialization strategy based on pushing exports, building capabilities and supporting industrial clusters.<br><br>
For the vast majority of Africa’s economies, the export market is the only option for rapid industrial growth. However, industrial growth need not depend solely on manufacturing. Agro-export value chains, tourism, and remote, IT-based tradable services also offer good prospects for job creation. Breaking into export markets will require an “export push”: a coordinated set of public investments, policy and institutional reforms focused on increasing the share of nontraditional exports in GDP. The distinguishing feature of an export push is that it must be a government-wide initiative, involving much more than the trade ministry. Macroeconomic management plays a key role, and improving trade logistics is vital.<br><br>
Often the critical constraints to industrialization are “firm capabilities”―the know-how and working practices that are used in the course of production or in developing new products. Firms in the global industrial marketplace are competing in capabilities, and the location of industry depends in part on how well economies acquire and diffuse them. Policies and institutions for attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) are key tools in capability building. Appropriate investment climate reforms are critical, and Africa needs to develop world-class FDI promotion agencies.<br><br>
Manufacturing and service industries tend to cluster. Because of the productivity boost that these agglomerations provide, no single firm has the incentive to locate in a new area in the absence of others. Governments can foster industrial clusters by concentrating high quality institutions, social services and infrastructure in a limited physical area―such as a special economic zone (SEZ). Africa’s experience with SEZs has been largely unsuccessful. Virtually all African SEZs fail to reach the critical levels of physical, institutional and human capital needed to attract global investors (Farole, 2011). A first step is therefore to upgrade the performance of Africa’s SEZs to international standards.<br><br>
Africa’s youth employment problem is primarily a deficiency of good jobs. Rapid labor force growth has resulted in increasing pressures on the job market, and, in most African economies, this pressure has meant growing vulnerability of employment, especially for the young. Less than 20 percent of African youth find wage-paying work. For this reason, the solution to the youth employment problem cannot be found in employment policies alone. A strategy for industrial development―including the growth of agro-industry and tradable services―will be needed.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T4">THE SECOND OBAMA ADMINISTRATION SHOULD CLOSE AFRICA’S ENERGY POVERTY GAP</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Todd Moss, Vice President and Senior Fellow, Center for Global Development<br><br>
Stephanie Majerowicz, Researcher, Center for Global Development<br><br>

It’s 2013 and nearly 7 out of every 10 Africans have no access to modern electricity; 8 out of 10 lack access to clean cooking stoves. Energy poverty―defined as the inability to cook with modern cooking fuels and a lack of minimum lighting for productive activities at sunset―affects the health, education and economic opportunity of almost 600 million Africans.
And yet, universal access to electricity is entirely achievable. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), reaching universal energy access by 2030 would require $48 billion a year in global investment (about 3 percent of global energy investment), yet only $9 billion is being invested per year in closing the energy gap (2011).<br><br>
Moreover, since the bulk of the world’s energy poor live in countries with very low carbon emissions (Ethiopian per capita carbon emissions are less than 1 percent of the American level), environmental concerns are no excuse for preventing expansion in energy access. In fact, the International Energy Agency predicts that achieving universal energy access through a mixture of renewable and fossil fuel sources would increase global carbon emissions by less than 1 percent by 2030 (2011). With continued energy poverty in the forecast, a U.S. policy framework to promote a reduction in the African energy gap could achieve a substantive legacy for the Obama administration, while at the same time boost business and broader development targets in the region.<br><br>
Why is It Important to Bridge Africa’s Energy Gap?<br><br>
Energy poverty severely impacts health and education prospects. Today, energy poverty leads to more premature deaths than either malaria or tuberculosis. The World Health Organization estimates that almost 4,000 people per day die prematurely each year from household air pollution from biomass cooking. If nothing is done to address energy poverty, by 2030 this number is expected to climb to 1.5 million per year―more deaths than will be caused by HIV/AIDS and malaria combined (IEA, 2011). Energy poverty also affects the provision of health services (vaccines are hard to refrigerate without electricity) and hinders education prospects (it is hard to read in the dark without electricity and girls often get pulled out of school to collect firewood).<br><br>
Access to affordable electricity is also a major―and in many countries the very top―constraint to economic growth. Business survey data consistently point to the cost and reliability of electricity as among the most important barriers to business expansion in Africa (Ramachandran et al., 2009). For instance, Ghana’s Valco aluminum smelter is today running at just 20 percent capacity due to a shortage of low-cost power. In Nigeria, 97 percent of large firms rely on (costly, inefficient and polluting) diesel generators to provide nearly two-thirds of their power, while almost half of all firms operating in sub-Saharan Africa own or share a generator. The economic returns to modern electricity could be huge for these economies. It is no coincidence that investment in the power sector is a priority for almost every African government.<br><br>
What Needs to Happen to Put Energy　on the Agenda in 2013?<br><br>
What will be President Barack Obama’s legacy in Africa? President Bill Clinton championed the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), still the core of U.S.-Africa trade relations. President George W. Bush built the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, the President’s Malaria Initiative and the Millennium Challenge Corporation―all still with us today. What kind of legacy can the Obama administration leave that addresses the pressing challenges constraining African growth, takes advantage of U.S. comparative advantage, and is compatible with a tight fiscal climate? The next big White House effort in Africa should be to promote access to electricity, and here’s how:<br><br>
Leverage private investment by
rationalizing U.S. government tools<br><br>
The U.S. government has a variety of low-cost tools to leverage private investment in electricity projects. Yes, there is need for soft money to nudge projects along, encourage early-stage technologies and reach some remote areas. But the bulk of the financing for new power generation and transmission will come from private sources, multilateral development banks or government agencies like the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), which actually contributes money into the U.S. Treasury every year. Power is also an area in which American companies can make a major contribution while expanding their own market reach. However, U.S. government instruments to promote private investment are spread across the bureaucracy, and the current interagency setup is far too fragmented and confused to be deployed efficiently. At a minimum, the White House could play a convening role and force the various agencies to align around some common objectives. A central role should go to OPIC, which could more effectively lead this effort if it is allowed to keep more of its profits to bolster staff and is given modest additional authorities (such as equity capability and multi-year authorization). To make the effort a true legacy sustainable beyond one term, the White House could even consolidate parts of various agencies and programs that promote private investment abroad under one roof, for example, by creating a U.S. Development Bank built around OPIC.<br><br>
Deploy soft money efficiently<br><br>
USAID, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, the Department of Energy, and the Trade and Development Agency are all involved in energy projects in developing countries. They provide useful tools at various stages of the project process and could be especially critical to reaching remote areas or making some new technologies feasible to deploy in the short term. Given the fiscal environment, these concessional dollars will be a premium, so they will need to be used in an integrated and sensible manner. Hoping the normal interagency process can achieve this goal is unrealistic.<br><br>
Engage proactively with the Greens<br><br>
A sizeable part of the energy poverty gap can be closed via renewables and new off-grid technologies. OPIC is financing a lot of these investments already, but could do more with additional flexibility. But it is also true that most of Africa’s cities and industrial zones will invariably require additional traditional, on-grid power run by fossil fuels. Powerful political constituencies concerned with climate change or local environmental impact may see such an effort as a threat. <br><br>Pressure from these groups has already forced OPIC to adopt a greenhouse gas emissions policy that effectively prevents it from participating in almost all fossil fuel projects, even in countries that are extremely poor and currently have nearly zero emissions. Some compromise with environmental interest groups will have to be found that can both meet global emissions goals and allow poor people to turn on a light. One option may be to keep a ban on coal, but exempt the poorest countries from the carbon cap for power projects fired by natural gas, which typically produces about half the emissions of coal.<br><br>
As the Obama team contemplates its Africa policy priorities for the second term, a clear and public commitment to close the energy poverty gap in Africa could be a win-win-win for Africa, the United States and the globe.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T5">CHINA’S NEW LEADERSHIP AND SINO-AFRICA RELATIONS</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Yun Sun, Visiting Fellow, John L. Thorton China Center and Africa Growth Initiative<br><br>
Julius Agbor, Africa Research Fellow, Africa Growth Initiative<br><br>
Jessica Smith, Research Assistant, Africa Growth Initiative<br><br>

On November 15, 2012, the 18th Chinese Communist Party Congress announced the members of the new Politburo Standing Committee. Headed by Party General Secretary Xi Jinping, the fifth generation of Chinese leaders will decide the future of China and its relations with Africa and the world. The revelation of the long-speculated new leadership is yet to answer all the questions pertaining to China’s domestic and foreign policies. On the domestic front, China watchers eagerly await to see how the new leaders will tackle much-needed and long-overdue economic restructuring and political reforms. In terms of foreign policy, the world is trying to understand and evaluate the new leaders’ worldview, foreign policy posture and strategic thinking. For Africa, answers to these questions will determine how China’s changing internal and external priorities and strategies affect its approach and interest toward the continent.<br><br>
Common speculations about the new Chinese leaders’ foreign policy are divided into two schools. The traditional school believes that, given the collective nature of China’s top decision-making process and the legacies of his predecessors, Xi will stay on the course designed by Deng Xiaoping and loyally executed by predecessors Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao. <br><br>Characterized as “keeping a low profile,” this course sees conciliation and avoiding confrontation as musts in optimizing the external environment conducive to China’s economic growth. The more progressive school argues that China under Xi will become more assertive and hawkish, primarily because of the blossoming sense of empowerment from China’s rapid rise. Meanwhile, as China’s problems (economic slowdown and stagnation of political reform) intensify, the new leaders will need to exploit foreign threats to strengthen their legitimacy and divert the crisis at home.<br><br>
Regardless of whether there will be a fundamental or philosophical change to China’s foreign strategy, it is highly unlikely that China will pursue any major policy change toward Africa. Compared to the more urgent and turbulent relations with big powers (such as the United States) and with its East Asian neighbors (due to territorial disputes), Sino-Africa relations have been significantly more manageable, smooth and satisfying for Beijing. China’s current agenda on Africa will persist under Xi in the foreseeable future. Politically, China will continue to seek Africa’s support of the One China Policy (Taiwan is part of China) and of its positions at multilateral forums such as the United Nations. Economically, Beijing will still look to Africa for natural resources and markets to fuel China’s economic growth. Strategically, if U.S.-China competition continues to expand and intensify globally, China under Xi most likely will heighten its relations and cooperation with Africa, allocating more economic and political resources for the continent to foster pro-China policies in light of the U.S. competition.<br><br>
Who are the Key Chinese Players in
Sino-Africa Relations?<br><br>
Xi has gathered considerable knowledge and experience on Africa throughout his grooming process. During his five years as the vice president, Xi met with numerous African leaders in Beijing, familiarizing himself with Africa’s key concerns and building personal relationships. In November 2010, he undertook a seven-day trip to South Africa, Angola and Botswana, focusing on energy cooperation and infrastructure deals. Most recently, during the Fifth Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) Ministerial Conference in Beijing in July 2012, Xi participated substantially in the discussion on how to deepen Sino-African ties. Xi will be responsible for carrying out the $20 billion in foreign aid committed at the conference in the next three years. Between 2012 and 2015, supporting the development of Africa’s infrastructure, agriculture and manufacturing industry, as well as the region’s small and mid-sized enterprises will be on the top of his Africa agenda.<br><br>
At the time of this publication, the successors for the two most important positions in China’s foreign policy apparatus, the state councilor on foreign policy and the minister of foreign affairs, are yet to be announced. However, at the working level, Vice Foreign Minister Zhai Jun will most likely stay on at his position and hold the Africa portfolio at the Chinese Foreign Ministry. A veteran Africa hand himself, Zhai will be assisted by the special envoy for African affairs, Ambassador Zhong Jianhua. Zhong was the Chinese ambassador to South Africa from 2007 to 2012 and was appointed to the second most important Africa position at the Chinese Foreign Ministry earlier this year.<br><br>
Since assuming the position, Ambassador Zhong has made public diplomacy his key priority and frequently participates in international conferences, symposiums and policy dialogues on Sino-Africa relations. In recent years, China’s vast investment and infrastructure projects in Africa have helped to facilitate economic growth and improve local conditions in the region. However, the dark side of China’s resources-centric investment strategy is as substantial as its positive outcomes, raising questions about the transparency, governance, accountability, and environmental and social impacts associated with China’s economic activities in Africa. At the July 2012 FOCAC meeting, President Jacob Zuma of South Africa pointed out that trade between Africa and China is unbalanced and the pattern is problematic (Hook, 2012). These concerns voiced by Zuma have in some respects begun to erode the foundations of Sino-African relations with the potential of jeopardizing Beijing’s Africa policy. Therefore, Ambassador Zhong’s portfolio is necessitated by China’s declining image and degrading relations with local African communities.<br><br>
Africa’s Expectations for China’s New Leaders<br><br>
From the African perspective, these concerns resonate across the continent. As the new Chinese leaders settle in, work should start on the implementation of the FOCAC Beijing Action Plan (2013-2015), which provides China a framework for working with African leaders. Currently, the action plan stands as rhetoric only, and it will be up to African leaders in 2013 to take action on issues such as increased voice in global governance, increased employment for African youth, heightened attention to labor standards and improved transparency of environmental contracts (FOCAC, 2012). African policymakers know that they are sitting on a demographic time bomb and therefore want their future engagement with China to translate into job opportunities for their growing young population. While a few African leaders (notably President Michael Sata of Zambia) have been vocal in their criticisms of Chinese labor standards on the continent, African civil society or ganizations have been more active on the environmental front. A typical example is Ikal Angelei, an African environmental activist, who has been pushing hard for improved environmental standards with China in Africa. Angelei has successfully blocked funding from the World Bank, the European Investment Bank and the African Development Bank for a Chinese hydroelectric project in Ethiopia (Gibe III) until environmental impact assessments are conducted (The Goldman Environmental Prize, 2012). In terms of global governance, Africa assisted China in regaining its seat in the United Nations in 1971 (Hook, 2012). This interaction points toward a long-standing relationship between Africa and China to enhance the voice of the Global South in institutions such as the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and G-20.<br><br>
Africa’s priorities should not just be rhetoric. They represent the region’s search for a long-term development model and its demand for China to contribute to rather than sabotage the process. Democratic governance and the rule of law have been the two cornerstones anchoring the recent socio-political stability and economic growth of African states. In the consolidation process, China’s current economic model undercuts the attempt to build good governance practices and fundamentally risks reversing the gains achieved so far. Therefore, many Africans hope China’s new leaders will shift China’s priority from short-term resource exploitation to a more long-term sustainable development model. Specifically, Africans expect that technology transfer, institutional support toward strengthening local governance and the overall regulatory environment should become integral parts of China’s “new” strategy in Africa.<br><br>
Whether the new Chinese leaders will be able to meet the expectations of Africans remains to be seen. After all, China’s new leaders have several pressing problems to address at home, and changing the country’s current mercantilist policy in Africa might not be in its short-term interest. Furthermore, without political reform and better governance at home, it would be unrealistic to expect China to adopt such responsible approaches toward Africa. Nevertheless, with the new leadership in place, the hope is higher than ever for China to change and to improve, not only itself, but also its relations with Africa.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T6">DISCORDANT（不和） DEVELOPMENT AND INSECURITY IN AFRICA</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Richard Joseph, Nonresident Senior Fellow, Africa Growth Initiative<br><br>

The good news about Africa is that many countries are now showing sustained economic growth. Not to be overlooked, however, are the persistent security dilemmas in many parts of the continent exacerbated by “discordant development.” Addressing these troubling problems of security and social unrest requires an understanding of the complex factors involved and the need for innovative approaches. The idea of discordant development conveys more than just “unequal development,” but rather how deepening inequalities and rapid progress juxtaposed with group distress can generate uncertainty and violent conflict. Unfortunately, continued discordant development is in the forecast for sub-Saharan Africa in 2013.<br><br>
The International Monetary Fund’s 2011 World Economic Outlook shows a score of fast-growing African economies. While such statistics reveal successful economic growth, they also often conceal discordant development. For example, in terms of GDP growth, over the past two decades Mali tracks just behind Ghana: 3.8 percent vs. 4.4 percent growth in the 1990s and 5.6 percent vs. 6.5 percent growth since 2000, respectively. The two countries do not seem that far off from each other in terms of economic growth. Yet, this is the same Mali that is now sundered and in disarray; meanwhile Ghana has experienced both political and economic progress while at the same time strengthened national unity.<br><br>
Another example is Nigeria, which has experienced a robust increase in GDP from 2.9 percent in the 1990s to 8.9 percent in the following decade. However, poverty rates in Nigeria have increased and continue to rise. Most of the northern part of the country has been in economic free fall, and the share of manufacturing―an essential component for job creation and employment growth―has been stagnant. Insecurity is the flip side of discordant development, whether previously in the oil-producing Niger Delta, in recurrent inter-communal violence in the Middle-Belt (central Nigeria) and recently in the appalling onslaughts in the northeast attributed to Boko Haram.<br><br>
Unfortunately, much of the recent analysis of insecurity in Africa recommends action without delving into the underlying problems. There has been insufficient examination of the causes of Africa’s persistent unrest and violence, one of which is discordant development.<br><br>

Discordant Development and Insecurity<br><br>
What are some of the principal causes of discordant development? The first is the African jigsaw bequeathed by the colonial carve-up of the continent. Governments located in the capitals of vast countries, such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Sudan, as Jeffrey Herbst shows in States and Power in Africa (2000), have never projected power over their extensive domains. African regional and continental organizations should take up an issue that is usually verboten: Are some post-colonial territories simply ungovernable? Can all of the massive DRC ever be governed from Kinshasa in its extreme southwest? J. Peter Pham (2012) advocates, as Herbst and others have long done, that the DRC should be subdivided into more viable states that can enhance security and promote development. In an era of renewed growth in Africa, many Congolese are condemned to lives of extreme deprivation.<br><br>
Look at Mali on a map. It consists of one large triangle in the north connected to a smaller one in the south that includes the capital, Bamako. Travel throughout this “nation” of disparate peoples has been daunting at the best of times. There are calls for urgent international and continental action to re-establish sovereign authority in Mali and evict the jihadist regime from the north. As the prolonged failure to achieve such an outcome in Somalia demonstrates, external forces cannot rebuild nations in the absence of domestic forces able to cohere to pursue such an objective. The restoration of peace and stability in Mali must include a framework for making this sprawling and disjointed territory more governable.<br><br>
Discordance has been fostered by state capture in countries that are ethnically, linguistically and religiously plural. New discoveries of exploitable oil, gas, coal and other minerals are increasing the stakes of state capture and prebendalism, i.e., government officials using state offices as prebends to serve themselves, their cronies and kinfolk but not the public (Adebanwi & Obadare, 2013). Therefore, the current African growth spurt should not lead to a relaxation of efforts to increase transparency, accountability and law-based governance. Without external pressure and scrutiny, the vast oil revenues of Angola, another increasingly discordant state, will continue to finance plush lives for the political leaders and their circle while basic services for the population languish. After a half century of oppressive rule, a breakthrough to constitutional government in Guinea is at risk of following the path of the similarly richly endowed Congo, perennially wracked by war and predation. As Anne Pitcher demonstrates (2012), peace and democratic progress in countries such as Mozambique have enhanced significantly the prospects for sustainable development.<br><br>
Recommended Policy Responses to Discordant Development for 2013<br><br>
How can African governments and agencies and their external partners respond to this commingling of progress and regress?<br><br>
First, sustaining growth and avoiding discordant development require not only enlightened leaders but also robust democratic institutions and vigilant civil societies. As the cases of Zambia and Senegal demonstrate, a Frederick Chiluba or an Abdoulaye Wade, after coming to power through popular action, can slip onto the rails of nepotistic and prebendalist politics. Fortunately, their tenure of office was terminated by the same democratic system that put them there, and their countries were spared having political contestation disintegrate into violent struggle.<br><br>
Second, it is important that analysts do not view Africa solely through “polarizing lenses,” either screening out security challenges in growing economies or overlooking axes of growth in conflict-plagued societies. Recent initiatives by the government of Brazil to promote affirmative action for the benefit of disadvantaged communities and to ensure the national sharing of oil revenues, can be profitably studied by Africa experts. Yet, just sharing revenues is not enough, as politicians can pillage the proceeds meant for their communities as the Nigerian experience tragically demonstrates.<br><br>
Third, democratizing countries in Africa must ensure steady progress in the fairness of their electoral procedures and the appropriate behavior of politicians to avoid the provocation of violent upheavals. Elections in Kenya in 2007 and Nigeria in 2011 were followed by horrific communal conflicts, each severely damaging their economies. Ghanaians pulled back from the verge of a possible conflagration during the closely fought elections of December 2008. The December 2012 elections were conducted peacefully despite polling difficulties and claims of electoral fraud by the opposition party. It is an example that Kenyan and other emerging democracies must emulate. Several Kenyan politicians will be made to account for their alleged role in inciting election-related violence in 2007-2008 by the International Criminal Court. But this issue cannot be left up to external agencies. Organized thuggery has been a part of electoral politics of many African countries for decades and must be eradicated.<br><br>
The new era of accelerated growth requires the normalization and “pacification” of electoral competition. Even an ideologically polarized society such as Venezuela can conduct national elections in which votes are fairly recorded, and winners and losers move on to compete another day. The same goes for India, which, though riven by religious, ethnic, communal and caste divisions, conducts competitive elections without provoking inter-group slaughter. It is up to African organizations to build traditions of peaceful electoral competition and connect these to improving the environment for long-term capital investments. Vital leadership in this regard can be provided by regional organizations, such as the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the East African Community (EAC) and the Southern African Development Community (SADC).<br><br>
In the discourse on growth and development, appropriate attention should be devoted to the recognition that no African country will achieve sustainable progress while significant sub-groups of its population regress. Some of the causes of discordant development have been highlighted here. Yet, there is significant variance among countries so no one formula can be applied to a continent of over 50 states. The guiding principle is that the now vital industrial transformation of African economies depends on the emergence of more effective states, law-based government and inter-communal peace.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T7">BUILDING OPPORTUNITIES: ADDRESSING AFRICA’S LACK OF INFRASTRUCTURE</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
John Mukum Mbaku, Nonresident Senior Fellow, Africa Growth Initiative<br><br>

In late 2012, Kenya announced a plan to spend $25 billion on various infrastructure projects. These projects include a 2,000-kilometer pipeline from South Sudan to the northern Kenyan town of Lamu and related improvements to Lamu’s port. <br><br>President Jacob Zuma of South Africa also recently announced that the country will spend $97 billion on infrastructure investments (McGroarty & Maylie, 2012). These funds are to be used specifically to improve and upgrade roads, transportation networks and ports. Like Kenya, South Africa plans to borrow the money for this ambitious investment plan. The international credit rating community is likely to view these ambitious investments with a pinch of skepticism because of the economic and political challenges associated with such public investments (Juma, 2012). In most African countries, where corruption in the public sector remains a serious challenge for governments, the efficient management of public finances must be a top public policy priority. Yet, as these countries struggle to reduce corruption in the public sector, they must seek ways to invest in the provision of basic infrastructure, which is the foundation for sustainable economic growth and development. African governments must recognize the critical role they have to play in the provision of a solid foundation for national economic transformation. They must also provide the social capital to anchor sustainable economic growth and enhance human development. Of course, each government must work closely with the private sector to mobilize the resources required to provide the infrastructure needed to meet the deficit.<br><br>
Building Roads, Spurring Growth, Securing Food<br><br>
In order for African countries to utilize their abundant natural resources in productive ways, they must develop much-needed infrastructure to serve as the foundation for all wealth-creating activities.<br><br>
Today, intra- and inter-African trade is being hampered by a lack of appropriate physical infrastructure. In fact, the failure of many rural inhabitants in African countries to efficiently access urban markets via farm-to-market roads has made it very difficult for these citizens to improve farm productivity through specialization and trade. In addition, the few roads that do exist within urban areas are poorly maintained and usually not passable during most of the year. The sus tainability of infrastructure is as important as its provision. Corruption, poor planning, failure to make allowance for depreciation and other forms of political opportunism continue to hamper the effective maintenance of infrastructure in African countries. The solution, of course, lies in providing institutions that adequately constrain each country’s civil servants and political elites and minimize their ability to act with impunity.<br><br>
In addition to enhancing trade and commerce, infrastructure such as roads, airports and railways can significantly improve travel within a country, providing labor resources with the opportunity to migrate to areas where they are most needed. Perhaps more importantly, a national system of highways and railroads can provide opportunities for the types of cultural exchanges (e.g., between ethnic communities) that will greatly enhance national integration and minimize destructive ethnic and religious conflict. Sustainable economic and human development in many African countries today depends largely on the opening of national borders to trade and other forms of exchange, which is in line with Africa’s regional integration project. However, without fully functioning and viable infrastructure, the regional integration project will fail and these countries will not be able to reap the full benefits of intra-African trade.<br><br>
Past African Infrastructure Financing Efforts<br><br>
Most development strategists of the post-World War II period believed that the provision of infrastructure was critical for development in these countries. Such infrastructure included roads (especially farm-to-market roads), bridges, dams, power stations, telephone and irrigation systems, airports, railways and sewage disposal plants (Ostrom et al., 1993). In the 1960s, many foreign assistance strategies developed for African economies emphasized investment in infrastructure, with these structures expected to provide the foundation and wherewithal for significant improvements in agricultural productivity and eventual transition to manufacturing.<br><br>
As many donors to African countries came to realize, successful infrastructure provision and industrialization required more than providing each country with the financial resources to import physical capital from the developed countries. Official development aid was usually granted to governments and often tied to the political or economic objectives of the donor country, making it extremely difficult for African countries to fund infrastructure development.<br><br>
The Reality in Africa after More than Six Decades
of Independence<br><br>
Because of these challenges, most public spending was devoted to inappropriate or unsustainable infrastructure investments―a process that failed to improve agricultural production and foster the economic differentiation that was supposed to help African countries become more competitive globally. In fact, many African governments failed to provide essential infrastructure (e.g., farm-to-market roads, irrigation systems, rural schools) for improvements in agricultural productivity. Instead, these leaders invested in projects that offered significantly high political returns but produced a negative social surplus―so-called “white elephants.” An example of such a project is the Basilica of Our Lady of Peace of Yamoussoukro in Cote d’Ivoire, built between 1985 and 1989 at a cost of $300 million (Elleh, 2002). As a consequence, today African countries have a serious deficit in the type of essential infrastructure that usually forms the foundation for significant improvements in agricultural productivity―with an efficient agricultural sector providing the wherewithal for eventual transition into manufacturing and industrial production. Agriculture, primarily a rural occupation, is critical to Africa’s effective fight against poverty and its eventual industrialization and modernization efforts. However, “[t]he majority of Africa’s rural populations do not live within reach of all-season roads. As a result, they are not capable of participating in any meaningful entrepreneurial activities,” (Juma, 2012). More importantly, the lack of infrastructure may not only be depriving those living in rural areas from participating gainfully in economic activities, but it may also be denying them access to life-saving public services (e.g., health care, including prenatal care for women). Most of these services are located in urban centers.<br><br>
What Needs to Happen for African Infrastructure in 2013?<br><br>
Spending on infrastructure should be viewed as a long-term investment in a country’s productive capacity―an investment that will yield significant social, economic and political benefits for many years to come. Nevertheless, before proceeding with plans to invest in infrastructure development, each African country should undertake a thorough and comprehensive analysis of existing infrastructure. Such an analysis should determine the feasibility of repairing and upgrading existing structures, and a dedicated account should be set up for depreciation and maintenance of each unit of infrastructure. The latter process must be followed for all investment in new infrastructure. Such an analysis, with input from and the participation of all relevant stakeholders, should help the government develop a national infrastructure blueprint.<br><br>
Consideration should be given to the adoption of a regional approach to infrastructure construction and maintenance. In the case of highways and railways, for example, there may be significant economies of scale to be derived from countries working together to construct and maintain roads that offer significant opportunities for regional trade and other forms of exchanges. In addition, in seeking financing for these projects, a regional approach may strengthen the ability of these countries to: (1) negotiate credit terms with international financial institutions; (2) secure necessary inputs for construction; and (3) contract with the various nondomestic companies that are likely to participate in the construction of the various structures. Such a regional approach would actually be in line with the African Union’s recent push to make intra-Africa trade a priority for 2013. An example of such an innovative approach to infrastructure investment is Kenya’s Lamu Port-South Sudan-Ethiopian Transport corridor project, which is designed to link Kenya’s coast with South Sudan and Ethiopia, effectively opening up the region for trade and other forms of exchange.<br><br>
The African Development Bank (AfDB) has prioritized financing for infrastructure development in the continent. The AfDB is not only making financial resources for investment in infrastructure in Africa available, but it is also providing a platform for various stakeholders on the continent to examine issues critical to the provision, maintenance and utilization of infrastructure services. For example, the AfDB co-hosted (with the U.S. government) a meeting of the Infrastructure Consortium for Africa in Maputo, Mozambique in late November 2012. Among topics discussed were “enhancing coordination amongst infrastructure stakeholders,” “facilitating regional infrastructure programs,” and “increasing knowledge and information infrastructure in Africa” (AfDB, 2012).<br><br>

African countries should consider 2013 the year in which they engage their citizens to effectively attack the problem of the infrastructure deficit with a view to ameliorating it. However, the following historical lessons must be kept in mind: (1) The tendency of African civil servants and politicians to opt for so-called “prestige projects” or “white elephants”―infrastructure projects that generate significant benefits for governing elites but provide very little or even negative social value―must be severely constrained; (2) infrastructure projects must be considered a part of the overall process of economic and social transformation in order to avoid ending up with, for example, a “bridge to nowhere”; (3) while investing in infrastructure, the government must make certain that public policies do not undermine the effective functioning of new structures―for example, what use is a brand new public hospital if the poor must bribe hospital staff in order to get treated there?; (4) the private sector must be made a full participant in infrastructure provision projects; (5) adequate allowance must be made for depreciation and maintenance of new structures; and (6) the institutional environment within which these new investments are to be made must be one that (i) promotes openness and transparency in government; (ii) adequately constrains civil servants and politicians in order to minimize corruption and impunity; (iii) promotes peaceful coexistence; and (iv) generally guarantees the rule of law.<br><br>
Seeking and securing the necessary financing for infrastructure provision in Africa is likely to be quite challenging. Even with the interest and willingness of the AfDB to undertake financing for infrastructure provision in the continent, African countries will still have to engage in various forms of creative and innovative approaches to secure the funds that they need to build and sustain the necessary infrastructure for development. Some of these innovative approaches may include those originating from the public sector but involving the participation of the private sector (e.g., public-private partnerships); those involving the public sector exclusively (e.g., infrastructure bonds denominated in local currencies, as well as commodity-linked bonds); and financial instruments designed to help each country access funds from international markets (e.g., sovereign external bonds, diaspora bonds, private equity funds, etc.) (Brixiova et al., 2011).<br><br>

	<b><a name="T8">MORE THAN JUST SENDING MONEY HOME: ENGAGING THE DIASPORA AS A PRIORITY FOR AFRICA’S DEVELOPMENT</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Anne W. Kamau, Africa Research Fellow, Africa Growth Initiative<br><br>
Mwangi S. Kimenyi, Director and Senior Fellow, Africa Growth Initiative<br><br>

Africa’s recent growth, which has been associated with significant economic, institutional and governance reforms, reflects a continent that is ripe for economic transformation. However, for Africa’s economies to successfully transition from their current state of commodity-dominated production to high value-added, job-creating production, the continent must design and implement strategies to harness large amounts of resources efficiently. One such opportunity that is grossly underutilized is the engagement of the large African diaspora. For the most part, the diaspora’s contribution to development has been viewed only in terms of remittances that go primarily to support families. However, the African diaspora represents a huge reservoir of human and financial capital and an important bridge between African and developed countries. In 2013, African countries and regional organizations are expected to accelerate their efforts to harness the diaspora to support transformative development. However, to accomplish this task, Africa needs to be more systematic, structured and strategic in its engagement with its diaspora.<br><br>
Why is it Important to Harness the Diaspora?<br><br>
Over the last few years, the African Union and many African countries that were once suspicious of the diaspora have begun to realize the promising role the diaspora can play in development. Many countries are exploring approaches to engagement. Development organizations, such as the World Bank and the African Development Bank (AfDB), as well as foreign governments have highlighted the role that the diaspora can play in the development of the continent (AfDB, 2011; Plaza & Ratha, 2011; Shimeles, 2010).<br><br>
Estimates show that the “voluntary” African diaspora (Africans who migrated to other countries by choice) is large and has been growing in the last few decades. In fact, the Migration Policy Institute estimates that there are approximately 30.6 million Africans in the diaspora (2012). A majority of them are migrants within Africa (14.5 million), whereas 8.2 million and 2 million Africans, respectively, call Europe and the Americas home (Migration Policy Institute, 2012). In general, members of the voluntary diaspora have more education, significantly higher incomes and larger amounts of money in banks outside Africa than their counterparts in Africa. Many have important skills and experiences that could fill capacity gaps in the continent if appropriate engagement modalities were in place. This group also sends huge amounts of money to their mother countries, estimated at $40 billion in 2010 (Plaza & Ratha, 2011, p. 7). Because of this potential, African governments need to increase modalities for channeling remittances toward financial development in their countries.<br><br>
There is also the involuntary diaspora―those with African heritage that did not migrate by choice―such as African-Americans. This group is located primarily in North America and the Caribbean. For the most part, the involuntary diaspora has not been provided opportunities for engagement by African governments. Yet African-Americans are a group that could contribute greatly to the advancement of Africa in many ways, such as through investment in the region and advocacy for Africa with their home governments. For instance, the African-American community in the United States―through the Congressional Black Caucus, the Constituency for Africa, TransAfrica and the Diaspora African Women’s Network―has been instrumental in lobbying for American legislation that benefits African countries. These groups could do more if African governments had better structured engagement and outreach with the diaspora.<br><br>
Learning from Asia and Other African Countries<br><br>
African countries can learn lessons from other emerging and developing countries that have successfully engaged their diasporas for economic and social development. For example, in Malaysia, TalentCorp―a partnership between the government, the private sector and the overseas diaspora―works to bring educated and highly skilled Malaysians living and working abroad back to the country.<br><br>
South Africa has a similar setup as Malaysia. The South Africa Network of Skills Abroad (SANSA) helps connect highly qualified and skilled individuals in the diaspora with opportunities to advance education, research and development in the country. Similarly, Nigeria has set up the Nigerians in the Diaspora Organization (NIDO) in various countries throughout the world. Rwanda recently started a solidarity fund, in which the diaspora can contribute to the development of their country. While it is too early to assess the success of these African initiatives, there is hope that they will help contribute to the broader development of the region.<br><br>
Policy Considerations to Better Engage
the African Diaspora<br><br>
Some countries have already begun to harness the potential of the African diaspora for the benefit of the continent. For example, the United States Congress recently proposed legislation (HR 656), the African Investment and Diaspora Act, to support African development. Ghana and Kenya have established units within their respective governments to oversee diaspora affairs. Yet, despite such efforts, engagement with the African diaspora by governments in the region remains largely ad hoc with few success stories. Efforts are still loosely organized, and diaspora members are unable to undertake large-scale collective activities that could better support their home countries.<br><br>
Build effective and targeted lobbying and advocacy groups<br><br>
The voluntary diaspora also has the power to put political pressure on its host countries for better policies toward Africa given that many of them hold citizenship in their host countries. However, formal advocacy and lobbying groups need to be put in place for the diaspora to undertake more targeted and effective collective action.<br><br>
Obtain better demographic information on the African diaspora<br><br>
Many African countries are not able to give an accurate description of their diaspora, so a good starting place would be a rigorous mapping exercise. Knowing the exact locations, characteristics, professions, incomes, savings, citizenship and length of stay will allow African governments to better understand their diaspora populations and tap into them for the development of their countries.<br><br>
Utilize diaspora bonds as a tool for development<br><br>
Since remittances from the diaspora have become an important source of foreign revenue inflow for Africa, African governments could benefit from a mechanism for aggregating remittances for development. For example, the World Bank has proposed diaspora bonds targeting large-scale infrastructure and energy. Kenya and Ethiopia have already introduced diaspora bonds, but the tool fell below expectations for various reasons (i.e., interest rate volatility, political risk, and lack of trust between government and guarantor). Perhaps repackaging the bonds and learning from the successes of India’s and Israel’s diaspora bonds would help guide African countries to create bonds that are better utilized for development financing. Part of the lessons to learn include: not limiting the diaspora bonds to the diaspora only; being flexible enough to provide different investment options based on market demands; making bonds tradable in the securities market; and offering a large discount to the diaspora with higher return rates than other bonds.<br><br>
Expand African banking to include clients in the diaspora<br><br>
With growing competition in the African banking sector, commercial banks are expanding their business to the diaspora population by sourcing deposits from them and offering them mortgages and other services. For example, 4 out of 43 Kenyan banks offer the Kenyan diaspora bank accounts with lower fees and higher returns. This move allows the diaspora to hold money in local African banks, which gives the banks the ability to mobilize deposits for loans to the private sector for development. More African commercial banks should look for innovative ways to bring down transfer costs and mobilize deposits in order to better engage the diaspora.<br><br>
Unfortunately, many opportunities for the diaspora to contribute to the development of Africa remain unexploited largely because of the lack of proper coordination and the inability to envision the importance of the diaspora beyond remittances. However, African governments and development organizations are now more interested in tapping into the diaspora population, and many initiatives are now working to engage these groups. In 2013 and beyond, it will be critical to continue with such efforts and scale up successes from both African and international experiences. Reaching out and engaging in a meaningful way will require committed leadership by African governments and also the members of the diaspora. <br><br>

	<b><a name="T10">Executive Summary</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
The African Growth and Opportunity Act
(AGOA), one of the defining characteristics of
the trade and commercial relationship between
the United States and Africa, will expire on September
30, 2015. So far, there have been heightened
discussions both by African and U.S. policymakers
on the post-2015 commercial relationship between
the United States and African countries, excluding
North Africa. These discussions have largely focused
on whether to extend the current legislation, and, if
so, for how long, and what elements of the current
legislation should be changed. Although there have
been propositions as to what may happen under
different scenarios, these are not supported by hard
empirical evidence and thus are not very useful in
informing the design of the post-2015 relationship.<br><br>
As AGOA’s extension is debated, it is important to
have empirically based analyses of how changes to
the legislation could affect trade patterns as well
as how changes in the global trading environment
could affect U.S.-Africa trade volumes and African
economies more broadly.<br><br>
This report provides an analysis of outcomes of
U.S.-Africa trade under five categories of post-2015
scenarios. These scenarios look at the trade and
income implications of i) not extending AGOA
beyond 2015; ii) expanded product eligibility for
AGOA; iii) revisions to the currently eligible countries;
iv) a restructuring of AGOA to resemble the
economic partnership agreements (EPAs) of the
European Union; and v) the effects that a possible
EU-U.S. free trade agreement (FTA) could have on
AGOA or an EPA-like situation, with an additional
scenario examining how a continental free trade area


(CFTA) would play into such an integrated trade
environment.<br><br>
The results indicate, first of all, that should AGOA
not be extended and current AGOA-eligible countries
revert back to the U.S. Generalized System of
Preferences (GSP), then trade losses would be distributed
in a very unequal fashion across the continent
due to the variation in AGOA-eligible products
that are exported by different countries. The
results also show that expanding product eligibility
for AGOA would only have small effects on the
exports coming from AGOA-eligible countries―
unless complete duty-free and quota-free (DFQF)
market access was granted because the most import-
sensitive sectors for the U.S. (e.g., sugar, cotton
and clothing) are still where Africa would gain
the most. The results of the analysis also show that
U.S. producers and exporters would not be affected
by providing these additional benefits. In addition,
the analysis shows that excluding middle-income
countries that are currently eligible for AGOA or
adding other non-African least-developed countries
(LDCs) that are currently not AGOA-eligible
would result in considerable trade losses and
increased competition for Africa. Last, the results
show that EPA-like agreements could result in large
losses in tariff revenue for African countries, but also
demonstrate the importance of regional integration
because there is a higher increase in intra-African
trade when EPAs are in place with a CFTA instead
of the currently proposed regional FTAs.<br><br>
These findings suggest certain recommendations for
policymakers, including extending AGOA beyond 2015: Without an extension, there will be declines
in African exports, economic diversification and
employment for many AGOA-eligible countries.<br><br>
Thus, there remains a strong case for continuing or
expanding the current preferences. The results also
show the importance for regional integration of
allowing African exporters to remain competitive,
and making efforts toward offsetting the potential
tariff revenue losses that could be experienced with
EPAs (or agreements like them) or external FTAs
that would compete with African exports. Increased
trade assistance and investment will likely be necessary for countries to ensure sufficient progress
in this area. There is also an obvious need for policymakers
to examine the idea of granting complete
DFQF access to the U.S. market for Africa because
of the large benefits it would provide for AGOA-eligible
countries and the low cost to the U.S. They
should also be careful in considering an extension
of AGOA benefits to LDCs outside Africa due to
the negative effects it could have for African economies.<br><br>
Last, there is an obvious need for AGOA-eligible
countries to further exploit the benefits of the
trade preferences available under the legislation.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T11">Introduction</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
The African Growth and Opportunity Act
(AGOA) was signed into law in 2000, marking
the beginning of a new trade-focused relationship
between the United States and Africa.1 AGOA
provides trade preferences for the continent that,
combined with the U.S. Generalized System of
Preferences (GSP),2 allow for duty-free export access
to the U.S. market for up to 6,400 product
lines3 coming from 39 countries in Africa.4<br><br>
Snapshot of U.S. Market Access under
AGOA<br><br>
As a consequence, Africa currently enjoys excellent
access when exporting to the U.S. market,
facing an average protection of less than 1 percent.5<br><br>
While African countries that are not eligible for
AGOA face nearly 2 percent protection on their
exports to the U.S., AGOA-eligible countries have
much better access to the U.S. market, with tariff
barriers averaging only 0.15 percent (see figure 1).<br><br>
However, this average global protection masks strong
disparities across sectors and countries. Indeed, the
U.S. remains more protectionist on its agricultural
imports (especially sugar, cotton and milk) than
on its industrial imports from Africa. Nevertheless,
even in industry, some key sectors for Africa are still
significantly protected, such as textiles and wearing apparel, especially those that are not eligible for the
textile and apparel clause under AGOA. As a consequence,
a few countries, such as Burkina Faso (a
large cotton producer and an AGOA-eligible country)
and Madagascar (a large textile and apparel
producer and currently not AGOA-eligible), face
significant average tariff barriers when exporting to
the U.S. (see annex A).<br><br>
<a href= "pic31.html">Exporting to the U.S. market</a><br><br>
Beyond the better market access obtained by African
countries when exporting to the U.S., the first
priority for AGOA, as written in the legislation,
is to “promote stable and sustainable economic
growth and development in Sub-Saharan Africa.”
In fact, since 2000 Africa has seen previously unprecedented
levels of economic growth. Many anticipate
that the decade ahead will continue with
these positive trends because the region is forecasted
to remain one of the fastest growing on the planet.<br><br>
Along with its increasing growth rates, Africa has
also quickly become a much more desirable region
in which to invest and with which to do business. 

Trade is expected to play a key role in catalyzing
growth and development. Africa’s total trade with
its traditional partners, like the European Union,
has remained high, and at the same time China,
Turkey, India and many other countries have seized
the opportunities for mutually beneficial growth
and commerce by engaging the continent. China’s
trade with Africa was about $10 billion in 2000,
jumped to $155 billion in 2011, and reached $180
billion in 2012.6 Therefore, and despite AGOA being
in place since 2000, China has surpassed the
U.S. to become Africa’s second-largest trade partner
after the EU (as shown in figure 2). U.S. imports
from AGOA-eligible countries have also increased
over the last decade, though they declined with the
onset of the global financial and economic crisis in
2008 and again in 2012. Total trade between the
U.S. and Africa decreased by almost $30 billion
from 2011 to 2012;7 mineral oil and fuel exports
from Africa constituted a large portion of this decrease―
making up about $22 billion of the total
trade decline.8 Under these conditions, although
AGOA certainly played a key role in reinforcing
U.S.-Africa trade relationships, trade preferences granted by the U.S. have certainly not been fully
exploited by Africa.<br><br>

<a href= "pic32.html">Trade Volumes for China, the EU and the U.S. with Africa</a><br><br>
Looking Beyond 2015<br><br>
As the U.S. considers its strategy for trade and investment
with Africa and the possible extension
of the AGOA legislation, understanding the ways
in which different forms of engagement could
affect trade with the region is crucial. AGOA expires
in 2015, and when this time comes there
are two obvious options: AGOA could be extended,
or it could simply be allowed to expire.<br><br>
If AGOA expires, it would mean the end of extended
trade preferences for Africa and a return
to earlier trade arrangements under the GSP,9
conditional upon the extension of the GSP, which
otherwise expires at the end of July 2013. Under
the possibility of extension, there are several different
scenarios, some in which AGOA’s trade benefits
could be restructured, others in which it could
be continued within the context of a very different
external trading environment. AGOA could be
restructured in a number of ways: It could include
or exclude certain countries; provide different or
extended benefits; or provide reciprocal benefits. In
addition, such scenarios could also occur within a
different global trading environment.<br><br>

This Report’s Structure and Baseline<br><br>
The following sections of this report present additional
descriptions and results for the different possible
scenarios that could unfold at the end of 2015.<br><br>
A baseline scenario is used to compare the effects of
each of the scenarios described in the report. The
baseline scenario proposes an extension of AGOA
to 2025, under the same preferential arrangement
whereby 26 of the 39 countries under AGOA qualify
for the textile and apparel clause. <br><br>A 10-year
timeframe was selected for the extension period in
part because it seems the most likely period of time
based on recent discussion. It is perceived to be a
period that will allow enough time for continued
investment in AGOA-eligible countries and sectors
that benefit from AGOA-eligibility while also
keeping in mind that the rapidly changing global
trade environment may prompt the U.S. to enter
into different types of preferential trade agreements
for Africa in the near future, such as reciprocal negotiated
agreements in lieu of unilaterally granted
trade preferences. Though shorter or longer periods
are possible, the 10-year period will allow for sufficient
analysis of trends. Below, five categories of
scenarios are compared to the baseline to gauge the
effects of changing the AGOA legislation from the
status quo.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T12">Category I Scenario: AGOA Expires in 2015</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Description of the Scenario<br><br>

Overview<br><br>
AGOA expires at the end of 2015, and the U.S. reverts back to the GSP for Africa,
excluding North Africa.<br><br>

If the AGOA legislation is not reauthorized in 2015, the U.S. would revert to the GSP granted to LDCs.
As mentioned above, returning to the GSP would mean that the extra 1,800 product lines for which
AGOA provides preferential access would no longer be duty free. The GSP would be the only preferential
scheme offered by the U.S. to Africa, which is also granted to 127 other developing countries in
the world.10 The following scenario examines how a return to the GSP would differ from the baseline
scenario of a 10-year extension of AGOA to 2025.<br><br>

Results for the Category I Scenario<br><br>
The first scenario envisaged in revising the structure<br><br>
of AGOA is a return to the U.S. GSP for all
AGOA-eligible countries. Compared to the baseline
scenario, which assumes extension of the current
AGOA situation until 2025, a return to the
GSP provides a better understanding and quantitative
evidence regarding how much Africa would
lose if a phase out of AGOA were to happen.<br><br>
It should also be noted that the results for this scenario
look not only at the effects upon trade and real
income for AGOA-eligible countries individually
and as a whole, but also at the effects of AGOA
on economic diversification and employment, since
comparing an extension of AGOA through 2025
(the baseline) to its expiration in 2015 provides the
most obvious evidence of its broader effects. <br><br>

From a protection perspective, annex A shows that
the removal of AGOA preferences would not have
a large effect upon the access of AGOA-eligible
countries to the U.S. market, with average global
protection increasing from 0.15 percent under
AGOA to 0.76 percent after a return to the U.S.
GSP, which continues to be low overall. Therefore,
it is evident that the rather good access enjoyed
by African countries when exporting to the U.S.
is essentially the result of the GSP scheme, thanks
to about 4,600 product lines already eligible for
DFQF market access under the GSP. This result
suggests that the additional 1,800 lines subject to
DFQF eligibility under AGOA do not considerably
improve the access of African countries to the U.S.
market on average. Having said that, some African
countries and products would actually see their protection
levels soar if AGOA preferences were to be
discontinued. <br><br>For example, the average protection faced by Botswana and Namibia when exporting
agricultural products to the U.S. would pass from
fully free access for both countries under AGOA
to an average 17.3 percent and 13.0 percent under
only the U.S. GSP, respectively. As far as industrial
products are concerned, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius,
Swaziland, Cape Verde and Kenya would also
face considerably higher average protection levels
on their exports to the U.S. strictly under the U.S.
GSP compared to AGOA.<br><br>
Those higher levels of average protection following
a return to the GSP for currently AGOAeligible
countries when exporting to the U.S. translate
into export losses for African countries to the
U.S. market. A return to the GSP would be detrimental
for currently AGOA-eligible countries as
a whole because their exports to the U.S. would
be reduced by 2.1 percent (or $1.3 billion) when
compared to the baseline in 2025 (see figure 3 and
annex G). <br><br>

<a href= "pic33.html">Changes in Exports</a><br><br>
Not surprisingly, the countries/regions exporting
products to the U.S. that would face the highest tariff
increases due to the discontinuity of AGOA preferences
would be the ones experiencing the largest
export losses. See the methodology section for the
countries/region classifications used in this report.<br><br>
For example, as the U.S. average protection imposed
on Namibia’s exports of agricultural products would
increase from 0.0 to 13.0 percent, and the ones imposed
on Lesotho’s and Swaziland’s exports of industrial
products would change from 0.0 and 0.4 percent
to 11.4 and 6.9 percent, respectively, following
a return to the U.S. GSP. The rest of the Southern African
Customs Union’s (SACU’s) total exports to the
U.S. would drop by 17.1 percent (see figure 3), with
exports of specifically milk and dairy products and
textiles and wearing apparel products dropping by
76.2 and 56.2 percent, respectively, as compared to
the baseline in 2025 (see annex H). In fact, a phaseout
of AGOA preferences would have the largest
effect upon several specific categories of products
exported from current AGOA-eligible countries to the U.S. The most affected would be milk and dairy
products (-10.2 percent), meat products (-60.7 percent),
textiles and apparel products (-51.2 percent)
and leather products (-8.8 percent) (see figure 4).<br><br>
Apart from textiles, apparel and leather products―
for which the exports reductions from currently
AGOA-eligible countries to the U.S. are to be
found in nearly all countries and are often large―
decreases in exports in other products are generally concentrated in a few countries: High export reductions
can be observed in milk and dairy products
for Nigeria, South Africa and regional groupings,11
such as the rest of SACU, rest of West Africa, rest
of Central Africa and rest of East Africa and in
meat products for Botswana, Nigeria and South
Africa. Lower but still meaningful export losses are
registered for South Africa in other food products
and other manufactured products, as well as for Mozambique, the rest of East Africa, South Africa
again and the rest of SACU in vegetables, fruit
and nuts, and also for Nigeria in oil (see annex H).<br><br>
The fact that AGOA is having considerably larger
trade effects upon certain countries and regions is
also indicative of the limited role it has played in
diversifying African economies (see figure 4). This trend tends to highlight the necessity for AGOA to
become more inclusive.<br><br>
<a href= "pic34.html">Changes in Export Products</a><br><br>

Employment<br><br>
In addition, evaluating the effects upon wages in
this scenario demonstrates the effects that a return

to the GSP would have on employment. Generally,
a return to the GSP would cause losses―although
quite marginal ones―in real wages, but the effects
on different regions and sectors vary significantly.<br><br>
Wages for unskilled nonagricultural employment
would see very large declines for specific regions,
concentrated especially in those with a larger textile
and apparel sector, such as the rest of SACU
(which includes Lesotho), Mauritius and, surprisingly,
Malawi, which does not have a very large
textile and apparel sector but which significantly
benefits from AGOA and would therefore be very
negatively affected should there be a return to the
GSP. Wages for unskilled labor in the agricultural
sector would not only be negatively affected for the rest of SACU, but also for South Africa,
Nigeria and the rest of East Africa. Wages for skilled
labor would be negatively affected in the rest of
SACU, Mauritius and Malawi―likely due to the
more skilled jobs within some of the industry-related
sectors (e.g., textiles and apparel) that would
be negatively affected. Many of the other regions
not mentioned above would see little or virtually no
effects upon wages in these sectors. The countries/
regions that would see declines in wages are also
the countries that would experience the largest declines
in exports should AGOA expire in 2015.12
Overall, however, it is clear that a return to the GSP
would cause large declines in wages for some countries
and regions.<br><br>

<a href= "pic35.html">2025  Real Wages for Workers</a><br><br>


These findings indicate that AGOA is clearly supporting African countries’ exports to the U.S.,
higher wages and, implicitly, employment. These gains do, however, seem to be large for only a
few countries and products and, as a consequence, a return to the U.S. GSP would affect African
economies and sectors quite unequally. Some export sectors, like milk and dairy products, leather,
meat products, textiles and apparel, and other manufactured goods would see less exports as
a result of the slower growth that these export sectors would experience. Whereas some countries
(in particular, Mauritius, Nigeria, Malawi, Botswana, South Africa, and a few countries from
the rest of SACU and the rest of East Africa) would be strongly hurt as far as trade and wages are
concerned by a return to the GSP. Others would not see their access to the U.S. market worsen
or their wages decline considerably after losing AGOA preferences.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T13"> Category II Scenarios: Expanding AGOA Product Eligibility </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Descriptions of Scenarios<br><br>
Overview<br><br>
(A) The textile and apparel export provision is granted to all currently AGOA-eligible countries.<br><br>
(B) DFQF access is given to 97 percent of all exports from AGOA-eligible countries.<br><br>
(C) DFQF access is given to 99 percent of all exports from AGOA-eligible countries.<br><br>
(D) DFQF access is given to 100 percent of all exports from AGOA-eligible countries.<br><br>


The following four scenarios are built on the premise of extending AGOA product eligibility by including
more items on the list of eligible commodities available for countries to export to the U.S. under
AGOA. The first scenario focuses on textile and apparel products only, while the second, third and fourth
scenarios examine what would happen if AGOA is extended to other product lines.<br><br>
Currently, AGOA provides duty-free export eligibility for textiles and apparel to 26 of the 39 AGOA-eligible
countries under the special textile and apparel provision. In order to qualify for the special textile
and apparel provision of AGOA, countries must establish a visa system that signifies that they are
able to prevent trans-shipment of textile goods as well as effectively monitor and track the sourcing
and sale of textiles. In addition to the textile and apparel clause, there is also the third-country fabric
rules of origin provision that allows “lesser developed,”13 AGOA-eligible, textile-producing countries
to source fabric for the production of textiles from other countries regardless of the source.14<br><br>
Not all the AGOA eligible countries fall into the category of “lesser developed,” and thus all are not eligible
for the third-country fabric rules of origin eligibility.<br><br>
Whether countries lack the visa for exporting apparel due to low production capacity of textiles and apparel,
are not eligible for the third-country fabric provision, or have difficulty regarding the capacity to set
up the needed visa system, it would be interesting to understand the ways in which having the textile and
apparel provision extended to all currently AGOA-eligible countries would affect exports in this sector.
The first scenario (II.A) thus explores this possibility.<br><br>

For the next three scenarios, extended product eligibility is considered more broadly, but keeping in place
the same textile and apparel clauses that existed as of April 2013. AGOA (including the GSP) provides
duty-free access to thousands of product lines, but there are still categories of products being exported
from AGOA-eligible countries to the U.S. that are not eligible for duty-free status, among them many
food and agricultural goods. Agricultural products account for a small percentage of all AGOA-eligible
exports to the U.S. Further, certain quotas are imposed on imports of agriculture commodities―such as
sugar, tobacco and peanuts―which are important exports for Africa.<br><br>
Expanding AGOA eligibility to additional product lines could be beneficial for African countries. In the
following two scenarios in this category, we assume that DFQF access is extended partially or fully to all
exports from AGOA-eligible countries. An index was computed to establish the products that are considered
most sensitive to the U.S. market. Import-sensitive products would be those that the U.S. produces
that are considered particularly susceptible to competition from foreign imports. The second scenario
(II.B) extends DFQF access to 97 percent of AGOA-eligible countries’ exports to the U.S., with the
remaining 3 percent of the most sensitive sectors for the U.S. market being excluded. The third scenario
(II.C) extends DFQF access to 99 percent of AGOA-eligible countries’ exports to the U.S., with only 1
percent of sensitive product lines being excluded (e.g., sugar and cotton). And the fourth scenario (II.D)
extends DFQF access to 100 percent of AGOA-eligible countries’ exports to the U.S.<br><br>

Results for the Category II Scenarios<br><br>
Considering African economies’ already good access
to the U.S. market, it would be expected that
scenarios looking at the extension of AGOA eligibility
by product would not translate into a surge of
African exports to the U.S. when compared to the
product eligibility currently existing under AGOA.<br><br>
The results of the analysis confirm this assumption.<br><br>
Indeed, current AGOA-eligible countries would
only increase their exports to the U.S. by $3.2 million
following an extension of the textile and apparel
clause to all AGOA-eligible countries as compared
to an extension of the current AGOA situation in
2025 (scenario II.A). In the case of DFQF being
extended to 97 percent (scenario II.B) and 99 percent
(scenario II.C) of AGOA-eligible countries’ exports,
then the increase of AGOA countries’ exports
to the U.S. would also be relatively limited, with
an additional $15.0 million and $33.3 million, respectively,
compared to the reference case in 2025
(see figure 6). Other regions would therefore lose a

slight amount of market access to the U.S., facing
higher competition from African countries. However,
overall, the changes in legislation would be
net trade creating. It is, however, important to note
that some African countries/regions would be able
to grab more trade opportunities than others―in
particular, the rest of West Africa, Ethiopia, Mauritius,
Tanzania, the rest of East Africa, South Africa
and the rest of SACU would gain some additional
export markets to the U.S. (see annex B).<br><br>
Potential gains can become quite significant at the
country/region and sector levels. Table 1, which
depicts the highest export increases depending on
scenarios exploring AGOA eligibility expansion
by product, indicates that when the textile and apparel
clause is extended to all 39 AGOA-eligible
countries, exports of textiles and wearing apparel
products to the U.S. from the rest of Central Africa15
and the rest of West Africa would increase by
14.8 percent and 9.1 percent, respectively, compared
to the baseline scenario in 2025. Not surprisingly,
extension of DFQF to up to 97 percent or 99 percent of product lines would provide larger market
opportunities to AGOA-eligible countries,
thanks essentially to the inclusion of textiles and
wearing apparel products not initially part of the
textile and apparel clause. For example, Zambia
and Nigeria would increase their exports of textiles
and apparel to the U.S. by more than 50 percent in
2025 following an extension of DFQF to 99 percent
of their exports to the U.S. when compared
with current AGOA product eligibility.<br><br>

<a href= "pic36.html">Changes in Exports</a><br><br>
Nevertheless, if the remaining 1 percent of protection
imposed by the U.S. on its sensitive imports
(e.g. sugar, cotton, diamonds, fish and some cereals,
as well as textiles and apparel and a few other
industrial products) from African countries were
to become eligible for DFQF access, then much
larger export gains could be registered by African
countries. Indeed, while―as already observed―an
extension of AGOA-eligible products to 99 percent
DFQF would bring an additional $33.3 million in 

2025 compared to an extension of current AGOA,
simply adding the residual 1 percent to the DFQF
list would increase African exports by another $72.5
million. <br><br>Specifically, if African exports were to be
granted 100 percent DFQF to the U.S., then African
exports of sugar would be considerably boosted,
increasing by 121.5 percent, 95.3 percent and
94.9 percent for South Africa, Nigeria and Malawi,
respectively, in comparison to an extension of current
AGOA product eligibility. Sugar exports to the
U.S. would also be enhanced in the rest of SACU
and Mauritius; plant-based fiber (essentially cotton)
exports from the rest of West Africa (inclusive of
Burkina Faso) would also be augmented quite significantly,
increasing by 21.7 percent. Africa’s exports
of textiles and wearing apparel to the U.S. would
also rise considerably―increasing by more than 30
percent in Zambia, Nigeria, the rest of West Africa,
Tanzania, the rest of Central Africa and Ethiopia, as
well as in most other African countries/regions, but
in more moderate proportions. <br><br>Exports of fish from Senegal, Uganda, the rest of West Africa, South Africa,
Mauritius and the rest of Central Africa would
increase. Mineral and metal products from the rest
of SACU and Malawi, and leather products from
South Africa and Mauritius would also significantly
increase, although to a lesser extent. Moreover, it is
important to note that if the U.S. is to grant 100
percent DFQF to AGOA-eligible countries, then
U.S. producers would only see their production diminishing
by $9.6 million, compared to an AGOA
extension until 2025 under current conditions.<br><br>

<a href= "pic37.html">Highest Changes in Exports</a><br><br>
Thus, expanding AGOA benefits by increasing
product eligibility would only deliver significant
and better distributed export benefits
across African countries if full DFQF
access was to be granted by the U.S. to African
economies. Moreover, it is important
to note that U.S. producers and exporters
would not be affected by having such concessions
given to African countries.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T14">Category III Scenarios: Revising the List of AGOA-Eligible Countries and Extending AGOA-Like Benefits to Non-African Countries</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Description of Scenarios<br><br>
Overview<br><br>
(A) Middle-income countries are excluded from AGOA.<br><br>
(B) Middle-income countries are excluded from AGOA, but all LDCs (African and non-African)
are included.<br><br>
(C) Middle-income countries are excluded from AGOA, but all LDCs are included, and the textile
and apparel provision is extended to all.<br><br>
(D) Both middle-income and non-African LDCs are included (but the textile and apparel provision
is unchanged from 2013).<br><br>

We build four scenarios that revise the list of AGOA-eligible countries, including removing some currently
eligible countries and extending AGOA-like benefits to some countries outside Africa. Recently, there have
been commentary and media reports on the possibility of South Africa being excluded from AGOA. Ideas
of whether middle-income countries (MICs) should be excluded or graduated from the benefits of AGOA
remain a topic of consideration in policy circles. The first scenario in this section (III.A) revises the list of
AGOA-eligible countries to exclude all MICs that are currently benefiting from the legislation.<br><br>
For the following two scenarios in this category, additional countries receive AGOA benefits but the
MICs remain excluded. Congress has introduced bills in the past16 suggesting the extension of AGOAlike
benefits to other developing economies―including countries like Bangladesh, Cambodia and Laos,17
which are low-income countries but whose production levels in many sectors, like textiles and apparel
are very large, in some cases much more than what the whole of Africa produces (e.g., Bangladesh).18<br><br>
In that sense, the second scenario (III.B) examines the effects of extending AGOA-like benefits to other
LDCs, while still excluding MICs (with no access to the textile and apparel provision). The third scenario
(III.C) is the same but also extends the textile and apparel provision eligibility to all LDCs. These scenarios
are also aligned with possible DFQF extension to all LDCs under the World Trade Organization
(WTO) in the near future, which would imply an erosion of preferences for African countries when
exporting to the U.S. market.<br><br>
In the last scenario in the category (III.D), MICs remain eligible along with non-African LDCs, and the
textile and apparel provision is kept as it is today and not extended to additional countries.<br><br>

Results for the Category III Scenarios
Of the 39 AGOA-eligible countries, 14 are MICs.19
Losing AGOA preferences (i.e., returning to the
U.S. GSP) would imply important trade losses for
all African MICs to the U.S. market, thereby offering
additional opportunities to export to the U.S.
for other countries, especially for those outside the
African continent (scenarios III.A, III.B and III.C;
see figure 7).<br><br>
Proportionately, Mauritius would be the most affected
if it were to be removed from AGOA, with
a decrease of its exports to the U.S. above 9 percent
compared to the baseline in 2025, regardless of the
scenario envisaged (see annex C). African MICs from
the rest of SACU and the rest of East Africa would
also register large drops in their exports to the U.S. In
absolute terms, Nigeria would be the country losing
the most, with a reduction of its exports to the U.S.

being more than $500 million. This dramatic drop
shows how much this oil exporter is currently benefiting
from AGOA. Annex 7, which indicates export
changes by countries/regions and main sectors,
shows that all MICs except Nigeria would mainly
see their market access to the U.S. reduced in the
textile and apparel markets. Exports from Nigeria to
the U.S. would, not surprisingly, decrease in mining
and energy, as well as in agriculture and food. Exports
to the U.S. in agriculture and food would also
be considerably reduced for Botswana and South
Africa, essentially due to the loss of preferences for
key products such as meat and milk.<br><br>
LDCs that are currently AGOA eligible would not
draw much benefit from the exclusion of initially eligible
MICs from the agreement, as LDCs would only
marginally increase their market access to the U.S.
(scenario III.A). Angola and the Democratic Republic
of the Congo (DRC) would register the highest gains, which would still only be a 0.2 percent (or $13
million) increase in terms of their exports to the U.S.
If the eight African LDCs that are not currently
AGOA eligible20 as well as the 15 non-African LDCs21
were to also receive the benefits of AGOA (scenarios
III.B, III.C and III.D), the main beneficiaries would be
non-African LDCs, even though their exports to the
U.S. would still remain rather moderate, with up to an
increase of 0.2 percent (or $71.4 million), unless the
textile and apparel clause were also granted to them.<br><br>

<a href= "pic38.html">Changes in Exports</a><br><br>
The limited gains when the textile and apparel
clause is not granted to all LDCs (scenarios III.B
and III.D) are consistent with the fact that the protection
faced when exporting to the U.S. market
for non-African LDCs is essentially concentrated in
textile and apparel products. Indeed, non-African
LDCs currently face an average global protection
rate of 9.2 percent when exporting to the U.S. (see
annex D). If these LDCs are to be granted AGOA
preferences not including the textile and apparel
clause by the U.S., then the level of protection imposed
by the American economy on non-African
LDCs would still be quite high, standing at 8.9
percent. Nevertheless, assuming that the textile and
apparel clause is extended to non-African LDCs,
it would make the average global protection level
faced by these countries when exporting to the U.S.
drop to as little as 0.3 percent―reflecting the fact
that protection faced by non-African LDCs when
exporting to the U.S. is mainly concentrated in textile
and apparel products. As a consequence, unless
preferential access is given by the U.S. to non-African
LDCs for textile and apparel products, then
trade changes cannot be expected to be large. <br><br>In that
sense, assuming that the textile and apparel clause
would also be granted to non-African LDCs would
hugely enhance trade gains for these countries
on the U.S. market. Indeed, if the clause offering
DFQF to a number of textile and apparel products is extended to all LDCs, then non-African LDCs as
well as Madagascar would get a boost in their textile
and apparel exports to the U.S. While Madagascar’s
exports of textiles and apparel to the U.S. would increase
by 99.9 percent (or $158.6 million), non-African
LDCs’ exports to the U.S. of similar products
would be augmented by 63.8 percent (representing
as much as an additional $4.5 billion), compared to
the baseline in 2025 (see annex C). This considerable
trade expansion for the East Asian economies
would be essentially and relatively equally divided
between Bangladesh and Cambodia, with $2.2 billion
and $1.9 billion, respectively.<br><br>
As a result, African countries would face higher competition
with East Asian economies when exporting
textile and apparel products to the U.S. market and
see significantly decreased exports to the U.S. Annex
C clearly indicates that all African countries―with
the exceptions of Madagascar, Angola and the DRC22
―would see their exports of textile and apparel to
the U.S. diminishing if all LDCs were to be granted
the textile and apparel clause. As a whole, exports of
textile and apparel from AGOA-eligible countries
to the U.S. would decrease by 37.5 percent (see annex
E) if the textile and apparel clause were to be
granted to all LDCs, as compared to the current
AGOA situation in 2025.<br><br>
The results from scenario III.D―which reflect a
situation where current AGOA eligibility is preserved,
AGOA-eligible MICs are included, and all
LDCs are also included (without the textile and apparel
clause granted to all)―confirm that textiles
and apparel is the category where competition from
non-African LDCs would have the largest negative
effect on African exports. Thus, unless the textile
and apparel clause is granted to all countries, the
competition with non-African LDCs should not
strongly limit African exports to the U.S.<br><br>


In brief, African MICs currently eligible for AGOA would suffer considerable trade losses if they
were to become ineligible for AGOA. Extending AGOA to all LDCs would only be a concern for
African countries if the textile and apparel clause were to be granted to all, in which case the
added competition would severely limit African exports to the U.S.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T15">Category IV Scenarios: Restructuring AGOA Based on EPAs</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Description of Scenarios<br><br>

Overview
(A) The U.S. has an agreement modeled after the European Union’s EPAs.<br><br>
(B) The U.S. has an agreement modeled after the European Union’s EPAs, while a continental
FTA is in place for Africa (unlike the regional FTAs of the normal EPAs).<br><br>

Category IV consists of scenarios related to changes to the current AGOA legislation. One such possible
scenario is for AGOA to be restructured into a form similar to the trade preference agreements being negotiated
elsewhere with the countries of Africa. The preferential trade agreements that have been getting
the most attention lately are the ones that the European Union is in the process of negotiating with the
countries in the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) regions, called economic partnership agreements
(EPAs). The EU has had preferential trade agreements with the ACP countries for about 30 years. These
agreements have provided preferential market access to the EU in an effort to foster growth and development.<br><br>
The EPAs would be different from these historical agreements in that they would provide partially,
though largely, reciprocal trade preferences that would involve the ACP countries opening their markets
and in turn providing preferential access to the EU.<br><br>
These agreements would gather the ACP countries into specific regional groupings. The five African
EPA-specified regions are labeled West Africa, Central Africa, and East and Southern Africa, the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) and the East African Community (EAC). Only the
EAC corresponds completely with an existing African regional economic community (REC), while only
SADC corresponds in name with an existing REC (the methodology section contains a complete list of
the countries in each regional group and additional information on regional economic groups).23<br><br>
The EPAs plan to provide full market access for ACP countries when exporting to the EU, and then
reciprocal access for the EU’s exports to the markets of the ACP regional groups within an agreed-upon
time frame while still providing certain protections for African markets. It is anticipated that 80 percent
of EU exports will have DFQF access to these regional markets and, therefore, the 20 percent most sensitive
products for African countries will still be excluded. For the scenarios in this report, complete DFQF access to the EU market will begin immediately (in 2016), and the delayed reciprocity portion will be
effective seven years later to allow some demonstration of the effects of these changes.24<br><br>
Thus, there are two scenarios modeled on the EU’s EPAs whereby the U.S. restructures its current trade
preference program to be exactly like the EU’s EPAs but only for African countries. The first of the two EPAlike
scenarios uses the exact same model of the EU, with the African countries of each regional group also
establishing an FTA (scenario IV.A); the second scenario has a CFTA in place beginning in 2017 (scenario
IV.B), which is the year that the Heads of State and Government of the African Union have decided upon25
for implementing a CFTA.26<br><br>

Results for the Category IV Scenarios
There has been a fair amount of discussion as to
whether a reciprocal agreement between the U.S.
and Africa―designed based on the EPAs currently
being negotiated by the European Union with the
ACP countries―could offer brighter perspectives
than a phase-out of AGOA or if it could represent
an agreement that is more likely than an extended
AGOA, since the EU is currently negotiating these
types of agreements.<br><br>
Before discussing the results of the EPA-like scenarios,
it should be noted that one of the disadvantages
posed by the EPA design is that the EPAs impose
certain structures of regional integration upon the
countries with which they propose to cooperate
and disincentivize forms of intra-African trade outside
those structures. By creating FTAs with specific
regions, certain countries are simultaneously being
excluded from other relevant EPA-established regional
FTAs. For example, the EPA group called
SADC includes only some of the countries that are
actually part of that regional economic community,
namely, Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique,
Namibia, Swaziland and South Africa. <br><br>The other
members of SADC are the DRC, Malawi, Mauritius,
Zambia and Zimbabwe, which have been
placed into different EPA regional groups. This
means that countries that border one another, like
Malawi and Mozambique, will not share a common
regional FTA and will not be incentivized to trade
with one another to the same degree that those
within the EPA-established FTA will. <br><br>

Therefore, while the following results show indications
of increases in trade flows, they do not totally
capture the way in which the EPAs are also working
against efforts toward increased intra-African trade.
The following results also indicate the importance
of establishing a CFTA in order to counteract these
effects. While a CFTA would help offset the possible
declines in intra-African trade that would result
from EPAs, it will be costly to finance necessary
complementary measures to tariff reductions, such
as improved trade facilitation.<br><br>
Having said that, when one looks at total export
variations from countries and regions following implementation
of scenarios assuming revisions of the
structure of AGOA, it appears that agreements that
envisage (asymmetric) reciprocity in terms of tariff
barrier reductions between the U.S. and Africa
would deliver higher gains than any of the cases analyzed
looking at an expansion of AGOA eligibility
by products or countries. Indeed, whereas Africa’s
exports would decrease by $400 million after a return
to the U.S. GSP, the continent would see its
exports increasing by $6.9 billion and $21.7 billion
if EPA-like scenarios were to be concluded between
the U.S. and Africa along with establishment of five
African regional FTAs or a single African CFTA,
respectively, compared to the baseline scenario in
2025 (see annex I for details by country/region).<br><br>
However, decomposing export variations by destinations
of exports show that the trade benefits
that Africa would get from such EPA-like scenarios
are due to the trade creation within African FTAs rather than increases in trade between Africa and
the U.S.
Indeed, it turns out that none of the African countries
would see their exports to the U.S. considerably
increase as a result of being granted 100 percent
free access to the U.S. market following an
EPA-like scenario, as compared to the baseline,
assuming extension of current AGOA preferences
(see figure 9). There are at least two reasons for this.<br><br>
First, since African countries already enjoy relatively
good access to the U.S. market, and as observed
in the analysis of scenarios looking at extension of
AGOA eligibility by products, a surge of exports
cannot be expected from fully free access to the
U.S. However, some countries, especially those facing
initially higher tariff barriers when exporting
to the U.S., would get non-negligible export―for
example, textile and apparel exporters (e.g., Madagascar,
which is non-AGOA eligible, and Mauritius)
and exporters of sugar (e.g., Malawi), as well as those exporting products in high demand outside
the African continent (e.g., oil from Nigeria).<br><br>
Second, African exports to the U.S. are being substituted
or replaced (limiting their magnitude or even
implying a reduction) by African exports to African
partners, thanks to the reduction of often high
tariff barriers that would be removed for countries
trading with others within their respective regional
FTAs. Therefore, EPA-like scenarios between Africa
and the U.S. would be trade creating for Africa,
thanks mainly to the deepened regional integration
in Africa envisaged by the agreement. Figure 10
confirms that Africa’s exports directed toward Africa
(i.e., intra-African trade) would increase significantly
following the establishment of FTAs.<br><br>

<a href= "pic39.html">Changes in Total Exports</a><br><br>

In the context of U.S.-Africa EPAs, the formation
of five regional FTAs would contribute to increasing
intra-African trade by $8 billion, while a CFTA would
help create as much as $37.5 billion in intra-African
trade, as compared to the baseline of simply 

extending the status quo AGOA in 2025. As previously
alluded to, the large difference in intra-African trade
gains between the scenario considering regional FTAs
and the one assuming CFTA attests to the still high
tariff barriers remaining between regional groupings
in addition to those within regional groups (which
are already being reduced) and provides a strong argument
in favor of an African continent free of tariff
barriers to help African countries take advantages of
economies of scale and trade opportunities. Furthermore,
the above-mentioned intra-African trade gains
would only be the results of a reduction or elimination
of tariff barriers to trade. Policymakers should
consider complementary reforms, such as the adoption
of trade facilitation measures on top of FTA reforms, which are expected to considerably enhance
intra-African trade.27<br><br>


Additionally, a decomposition of these intra-African
trade gains from FTA reforms shows that the
deeper regional integration in Africa, the stronger
the potential to increase the industrialization of
intra-African trade. Indeed, gains in textiles and
apparel and other industries account for about 55
percent and 62 percent of the total intra-African
trade gains, considering FTAs and CFTA, respectively.<br><br>


<a href= "pic40.html">Changes in Exports</a><br><br>

As far as the U.S.-Africa trade relationship is concerned,
U.S. exports to Africa would increase more than Africa’s exports to the U.S. after the implementation
of an EPA-like arrangement between
the U.S. and Africa. Indeed, a scenario assuming
regional FTAs (scenario IV.A) in Africa would result
in an increase of Africa’s exports to the U.S. of
$100 million when U.S. exports to Africa would be
augmented by $2.4 billion, compared to the baseline
in 2025. In the case of a CFTA within Africa
(scenario IV.B), Africa’s exports to the U.S. would
decline by $600 million, whereas U.S. exports to
Africa would still increase, but by $1.8 billion (see
figure 12). While the reasons for a relatively low
increase or even decrease (i.e., scenario considering
a CFTA) in Africa’s exports to the U.S. have already
been given, the increase in U.S. exports to Africa is
strictly due to the improved market access for the
U.S. when exporting to Africa as implied under the
EPA-like scenario. Under a CFTA, however, the
U.S. exports less to Africa than when regional African
FTAs are established because African countries
are offering more competition to the U.S. in the
African market, thanks to the lower tariff barriers
that would be in place on the African continent.<br><br>
<a href= "pic41.html">Changes in Exports from Africa</a><br><br>
In other words, the U.S.-Africa two-way trade variations
under the EPA-like scenarios reveal that although
such a trade agreement would be asymmetrical,
with Africa apparently required to grant fewer
concessions than the U.S.―which would immediately
grant 100 percent DFQF on its market to African
exports while Africa would progressively open
its market to provide 80 percent DFQF to U.S.
exports―such an agreement would favor the U.S.
in terms of the magnitude of market access gained
when exporting and therefore create potential trade
benefits. Indeed, average protection faced by Africa,
excluding North Africa (as these countries are not
part of the EPA-like scenario), when exporting to
the U.S. would be lowered to 0.0 percent from an
average tariff of about only 1 percent today, thanks
to the U.S. GSP and AGOA. At the same time, average
protection faced by the U.S. when exporting
to Africa would decrease from 11.3 to 9.9 percent.28
Although 9.9 percent remains very high, thanks to
20 percent of Africa’s imports from the U.S. being
classified as sensitive from an African perspective,
it still provides an average 1.4 percentage point improvement for a wide range of products in terms
of market access.<br><br>
<a href= "pic42.html">Changes in Exports</a><br><br>
<a href= "pic43.html">Changes in Africa’s Exports/Imports</a><br><br>
It is also important to note that despite trade gains
for Africa―essentially coming from the regional
integration dimension of the EPA-like scenarios―
the effects of such scenarios on real income
are quite ambiguous. Indeed, although as a whole
Africa would increase its real income with the ensuing
regional integration, figure 13 and annex J
indicate that some countries might be hurt while
others might get benefits. Such variable outcomes
for African countries could be explained by a number
of reasons.<br><br>
First, some countries initially face higher tariff barriers,
not only when exporting to the U.S. but also
when exporting to African partners, and thus register
significant gains from the liberalization reforms
(e.g., the rest of SACU). When these economies
are exporting more than importing, this leads to
real exchange rate appreciation, improving their
real incomes. This is often observed when countries
are more diversified in terms of their exports
(e.g., South Africa). Second, other countries already
enjoy good market access on their exports, which
does not improve much following the reforms
(e.g., Nigeria, Angola and the DRC). As a result,
these countries’ imports tend to increase more than

their exports. It follows that a depreciation of their
real exchange rates leads to a decrease in their real
income. This especially occurs when a country is
strongly dependent upon a few partners and products
for its imports (e.g., Botswana depends heavily
on South Africa for its imports). Third, and perhaps
most important, liberalization implies governments
renouncing tariff revenues, which often represent
a significant share of their incomes. Therefore, whenever the trade reforms result in important
tariff revenue losses, real income can be negatively
affected. Countries such as Zimbabwe, Malawi and
Mozambique see their tariff revenues reduced by
more than 50 percent after implementation of an
EPA-like scenario, assuming a CFTA reform; these
countries are among the most hurt in terms of real
income following the reform.<br><br>
<a href= "pic44.html">Changes in African Countries’ Real Income</a><br><br>
<a href= "pic45.html">Changes in Tariff Revenues</a><br><br>
The EPA-like scenarios present varying advantages and disadvantages for the U.S. and African
countries. The U.S. would see significantly increased exports because its market access
on the African continent would greatly improve, but it would actually see less of an increase
were a CFTA to be in place because the increases in intra-African trade that would follow such
an agreement would compete with U.S. exports.<br><br>
African countries would experience some trade gains, which would mostly be thanks
to deepened regional integration―especially if a CFTA was in place―but these trade
gains would be accompanied by varying effects upon real income, with some countries
seeing large declines likely due to reductions in tariff revenues. It should be noted,
however, that increased trade and transportation facilitation aimed at improving
cross-border trade could work to offset some of the potential real income losses.29
However, such measures in and of themselves could be very costly for African countries;
therefore, these countries should focus on seeking additional trade assistance.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T16">Category V Scenarios: AGOA within a Different Global Trading Environment</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Description of Scenarios<br><br>
Overview<br><br>
(A) There is an EU-U.S. FTA, and the EU implements its EPAs while the U.S. maintains AGOA.<br><br>
(B) There is an EU-U.S. FTA, but both the U.S. and the EU have EPAs with Africa, and there is a
CFTA in place in Africa.<br><br>

Category V scenarios examine the ways that Africa would be affected by the implementation of an FTA
between the U.S. and the EU. The possibility of such an agreement has been growing since the U.S.-
EU Summit in November 2011, when an exploratory process on the issue began. The idea was publicly
announced by President Obama during his State of the Union Address in February 2013, and in March
2013 he officially stated his intent to negotiate such an agreement to Congress. As of May 2013, comments
on the topic were being publicly accepted by the Office of the United States Trade Representative.30<br><br>
While it is too early to know the complete details that may be part of such an agreement, the scenarios
for this category are designed using information from the WTO negotiations in the most recent Doha
Development Round. In the first scenario (V.A), in addition to the U.S. and the EU having an FTA, the
U.S. continues to use AGOA as it is (as of April 2013), and the EU implements EPAs with the five different
regional groups. The five regional FTAs take effect in 2017, to provide the most realistic timeframe
possible. In the second model of this scenario (V.B), both the U.S. and the EU implement EPAs with
Africa, but there is also a CFTA in place within Africa beginning in 2017 (as mentioned above, the year
that the African Union has tentatively decided upon for implementing the CFTA).31 In both scenarios,
the EU-U.S. FTA takes effect in 2017 as well in order to provide a more realistic timeframe for its implementation―
it is assumed, for the sake of this scenario, that such an agreement, if signed, would take
effect before the end of President Obama’s current term.<br><br>

Results for the Category V Scenarios<br><br>
If an FTA is to be established between the EU and
the U.S., either in the context of an extension of
AGOA in the U.S. and negotiated EPAs between
the EU and Africa, or with the U.S. also taking
on an EPA-like reform, this could result in the
expansion of exports worldwide ranging between
$107 billion and $124.2 billion (see figure 15 and
annex L).<br><br>
Half the gain would be captured by the EU alone,
with the U.S. capturing the next largest piece.
Africa, especially the countries that are currently
AGOA eligible, would also benefit; the rest of the
world not part of any of the above-described agreements
would see its exports reduced facing higher
competition on EU, U.S. and African markets.<br><br>

Whereas the large trade benefits for the EU and the
U.S. may not appear to be a surprise, the magnitude
of the gains for Africa is interesting and deserves
scrutiny. In that sense, breaking down the expected
export benefits by destination may help one to better
understand the outcomes of the assumed reforms.<br><br>
To begin, the EU-U.S. trading relationship would
be strongly reinforced, thanks essentially to the
establishment of an FTA between the two giant
economies. Indeed, both U.S. exports to the EU
and EU exports to the U.S. would increase by more
than $50 billion (i.e., about an 11 percent increase
in U.S. exports to the EU and a 10 percent increase
in EU exports to the U.S.) resulting in an augmentation
of two-way trade between the EU and the
U.S. by over $100 billion, compared to the baseline
scenario in 2025 (see annexes M and N).<br><br>

<a href= "pic46.html">Changes in Total Exports</a><br><br>
While the two nations would register relatively similar
export gains when trading with each other, the
EU would benefit more than the U.S. from its respective
agreements with Africa.<br><br>
Whereas under scenario V.A, the U.S. would not
gain any additional market access to African countries,
which is consistent with the fact that AGOA
is maintained as also assumed in the baseline. The
EU would increase its exports to Africa by about $12
billion (i.e., a growth of 9.7 percent), thanks to the
EPAs in comparison to the reference case in 2025.<br><br>
When the EU and the U.S. would―in addition
to their FTA―both also conclude agreements designed
after the EPAs but assuming a CFTA within
Africa (scenario V.B), both the EU and the U.S.
would see their exports to Africa increasing, but in
different proportions: The EU would again gain more access to the African market than the U.S.,
and the EU would increase its exports to Africa by
$8.4 billion, while the U.S. would register a more
modest gain of $1.9 billion. At least two justifications
can be advanced for such an outcome: First,
the EU initially faces slightly higher tariff barriers
on average when exporting to Africa than the U.S.
does, with average protection rates of 13.0 and
11.3 percent, respectively, and EPAs therefore imply
slightly better improvements in market access
to Africa for the EU than for the U.S. Indeed, EPAs
scenarios imply that 80 percent of EU exports as
well as 80 percent of U.S. exports to Africa become
DFQF. As a consequence, the final average protection
faced by the EU and the U.S. when exporting
to Africa after implementation of the EPA-like scenarios
are 11.3 percent and 9.9 percent, giving the
EU a 0.3 percent larger decrease in protection faced
than the U.S. when exporting to Africa after EPAs. <br><br>
<a href= "pic47.html">Changes in Africa’s Exports</a><br><br>
Second, and probably more important, the EU is
by far the main source of imports for Africa, with
nearly 40 percent of Africa’s total imports coming
from the EU, whereas the share of Africa’s imports
from the U.S. accounts for less than 10 percent.32
Under this condition and the geographic proximity
dimension, when both the EU and the U.S. are
getting relatively equivalent market access improvements
when exporting to Africa, then the EU’s
exports to Africa tend to expand more than U.S.
exports to Africa.<br><br>
In addition, Africa’s export variations by main destinations
would increase toward Africa itself and
the EU, but would decrease toward other destinations
(see figure 16). Africa’s exports’ decrease toward
the rest of the world is evident as none of the
agreements designed in this fifth category of scenarios
envisage market access improvements for Africa
when exporting to those countries.<br><br>
The reduction by $2.1 billion of Africa’s exports
toward the U.S., at least under the scenario assuming
extension of AGOA (also assumed in the baseline
scenario), is straightforward, considering the
market shares lost because of the EU-U.S. FTA as
Africa faces more competition from the EU when
exporting to the U.S. However, a similar reduction
of Africa’s exports to the U.S. is observed when an
EPA-like scenario between the U.S. and Africa is
assumed along with EPAs between the EU and Africa
in the context of an African CFTA. Such an
outcome is not really surprising since―as already
indicated in the scenario for the fourth categories,
assuming an EPA-like scenario with the U.S.
only―deepened regional integration in Africa
would strongly stimulate intra-African trade, with
some of African exports toward the U.S. being replaced
by African exports toward African partners.<br><br>
Moreover, a few African exports toward the U.S.
may also be replaced by new African products to
the EU. Indeed, and despite the establishment of
an EU-U.S. FTA, an EPA between the EU and
Africa would actually enhance Africa’s exports by
$15.8 billion and $13.8 billion to the EU after scenario
V.A (five regional FTAs within Africa as part of the EPAs) and scenario V.B (when an African
CFTA is considered), respectively, compared to the
baseline in 2025 (see figure 16 and annex P).<br><br>
While the lower magnitude of African exports’ gain
to the EU, following the scenario inclusive of a CFTA
reform compared to FTAs within Africa, is logical
considering the strong boost in intra-African trade,
resulting in the substitution of some of Africa’s exports
to the EU by Africa’s exports to Africa itself, the
high volume observed in the case of “regular” EPAs is
quite interesting and requires some attention. In fact,
most of the increase in Africa’s exports to the EU is
highly concentrated in a handful of countries, essentially
the rest of SACU and to a lesser extent Botswana,
Mauritius, the rest of Central Africa and the rest
of West Africa (see figure 17 and annex P). Interestingly,
these countries/regions are those initially facing
the higher tariff barriers on their exports to the EU.
While the average protection faced by Africa today
when exporting to the EU is 1.2 percent―which is
comparable to the average protection faced by African
countries when exporting to the U.S.―there are
very strong disparities across countries and sectors.<br><br>
Indeed, the 33 African LDCs eligible for the Everything
But Arms initiative enjoy nearly free access to
the EU market, but African MICs can sometimes
face high tariffs, largely in agriculture.33<br><br>
Therefore, countries with initially easy access when
exporting to the EU could not expect strong export
increases when granted 100 percent DFQF thanks
to EPAs, whereas countries facing initially high tariff
barriers on their exports to the EU would see
them increasing, and sometimes to a large degree.<br><br>
For example, Swaziland and Namibia, two MICs
which belong to the rest of SACU, along with
LDCs―namely, Lesotho―face average protection
rates in agriculture of 100.3 and 70.9 percent when
exporting to the EU, respectively (see annex O) because
tariffs are particularly high in meat products
and sugar for these countries. The same can be observed
for countries such as Botswana, Mauritius,
the Republic of the Congo, Malawi or Zambia. As a
result, EPAs concluded with the EU generate great
export gains for these countries. In particular, just
the rest of SACU would see its exports to the EU increasing by over $8 billion (or 300 percent), representing
more than half of Africa’s exports increase to
the EU, following an EPA with the EU compared
to the baseline scenario in 2025 (see figure 17 and
annex P). This would come from relatively comparable
increases in just meat products and sugar
exports to the EU.<br><br>
As already mentioned in scenarios defined under
category IV, African countries’ exports to African
partners would increase greatly if a CFTA is to be
established, and it would also favor intra-African
trade of industrial products (see figure 18). <br><br>

However, real income effects would still be marginal
for African nations under a CFTA. Indeed, Africa
as a whole would improve its real income by $686.2
and $912.8 million following scenarios V.A and
V.B, respectively, compared to the baseline in 2025.<br><br>
Nevertheless, many countries (e.g., Nigeria, Angola
and the DRC, Mozambique, Uganda, Zambia and
the rest of East Africa) would still see their real income
decrease, depending on the trade reform implemented
(see annex Q). Significant tariff revenues
losses implied by trade liberalizations would greatly
explain such outcomes.<br><br>
<a href= "pic48.html">Changes in African Countries’ Exports to the EU ,</a><br><br>
<a href= "pic49.html">Changes in Intra-African Trade</a><br><br>
An African continent that is highly integrated with potentially reciprocal agreements between
the U.S. and Africa as well as between the EU and Africa would limit some of the potential trade
diversion for Africa if an EU-U.S. FTA is to be implemented. An increase in intra-African trade
following FTA reforms would produce enough export gains for Africa to compensate any export
losses that could occur due to the formation of an EU-U.S. FTA and EPA-like scenarios. Moreover,
EPAs could actually benefit a handful of African countries, especially those that still face
significant protection today, when exporting to the EU. Nevertheless, for most African countries,
export gains would not be sufficient to ensure real income benefits due partly to tariff revenues
losses implied by the trade reforms. As a consequence, tariff reduction alone does not appear
to be sufficient for producing positive trade and real income benefits to all, thereby justifying the
need for complementary measures.<br><br>

Overview of the Scenario Results<br><br>
The scenarios modeled in this report show a variety
of possible outcomes for U.S.-Africa trade
through 2025 and also demonstrate important
trends regarding the current direction for African
trade should AGOA benefits continue or be modified.<br><br>
It is important to note that discontinuing
AGOA would be detrimental for African economies.<br><br>
There would be declines in exports, decreases in the
possible progress of economic diversification, and a
decline in wages for unskilled nonagricultural wages
and skilled wages. The effects would vary based on
country/region and sector, with some being more
negatively affected than others, but keeping AGOA
in place would definitely provide much better results
than a return to the GSP. If AGOA is to be extended,
it should be noted that expanding product eligibility
is not anticipated to make a significant difference
in export benefits for Africa unless AGOA-eligible
countries are given 100 percent DFQF access. Even
with 99 percent DFQF access to all products, it is
still the 1 percent most sensitive import products
for the U.S. that would provide the most benefits.<br><br>
Such access could be provided at a minimal cost for
the U.S. (data indicate that it would only cost about
$9.6 million to U.S. producers while Africa’s exporters
would gain over $105 million).<br><br>
Scenarios that consider removing MICs from
AGOA eligibility indicate that they would suffer
export losses in their exports to the U.S. On the
other hand, granting AGOA eligibility to other 

non-African LDCs would not actually have much
effect on the exports of African LDCs to the U.S.,
unless the textile and apparel clause were also to be
granted to them, which would be expected to have
severe effects on Africa’s textile and apparel industry.<br><br>
Scenarios that assume some degree of reciprocity
between the U.S. and Africa in terms of preferences
granted would be beneficial for African exports
if they were also accompanied by deeper regional
integration within the continent, specifically if
the anticipated CFTA were to be in place. Without
considerably more regional integration on the
continent, there would not be such significant export
gains. It should also be noted that reciprocity
would result in large tariff revenue losses that could
have a negative impact on real income levels. Some
of the losses of tariff revenue could be offset by enhancements
to intraregional trade and transportation
facilitation; however, it should be stressed that
the level of regional integration required to counteract
these losses would be very costly to finance
and difficult to achieve without additional financial
support (e.g., additional aid directed at trade facilitation).<br><br>
Similarly, should the EU and the U.S. agree upon
and implement an FTA, deepened regional integration
in Africa could help offset export losses
that would follow as EU-U.S. trade would increase
and take some of the market share of African countries―
specifically, if a CFTA were to be put in place,
intra-African trade would increase. Increases in intra-African trade in this case would be accompanied
by some increases in EU-Africa trade (thanks to only
a handful of African countries, mostly from SADC,
following a rise of meat and milk exports to the EU),
but decreases in U.S.-Africa trade. While the increases
in trade would be beneficial, there would still be a
significant loss in tariff revenue that could have negative
real income effects for many countries.<br><br>
Thus, all the scenarios designed and analyzed provide
useful indications for post-2015 options, but
none of them actually allow for a clear win-win
scenario between the U.S. and Africa. In fact, it appears
from the findings that scenarios considering
only tariff barrier removal would not be sufficient,
and complementary measures would be required
to ensure that countries are better off following the
trade reforms.<br><br>
Policy Recommendations<br><br>
The results from these scenarios demonstrate a number
of lessons and options for increasing trade and
further developing the commercial relationship between
AGOA-eligible countries and the U.S. There
are also many implications regarding the necessary
strategies to pursue while promoting development
in Africa through real income growth, economic
diversification, and an increase in wages and employment.<br><br>
This section provides policy recommendations
for how both the U.S. and AGOA-eligible
countries can use the scenario results to promote
growth and better engagement.<br><br>
Renewing AGOA beyond 2015<br><br>
By far the most obvious result from these scenarios
is that AGOA provides, though with varying
strength, a great deal of benefits to the countries
of Africa and discontinuing AGOA or allowing it
to expire would create losses in exports and harm
employment. Should Congress decide to extend
AGOA benefits to additional countries outside the
African continent, African economies would suffer
export losses and lose market share when exporting
to the U.S. if complete DFQF benefits were given
to other LDCs. <br><br>

Reconsidering AGOA Product Eligibility<br><br>
The report identifies that products that are within
the most sensitive import sectors for the U.S. are
also the sectors where Africa stands to gain the most
by having DFQF access. It also shows that having
100 percent DFQF would not harm U.S. producers
and exporters. The U.S. could therefore consider
granting complete DFQF access to AGOA-eligible
countries because of the benefits it could provide in
terms of diversification and market access.<br><br>
Better Exploitation of AGOA Preferences<br><br>
Africa must look at taking better advantage of the
preferences it is being granted by the U.S. and other
partners, in particular identifying sectors with supply
chain potential. Additionally, lowering the often relatively
high tariffs imposed by African countries on their
imports of intermediate goods (as it could be expected
from an African common external tariff set under a
Continental Customs Union) may allow them to use
cheaper inputs into their production process and add
value to the goods that can then be exported.<br><br>
Prioritizing Regional Integration<br><br>
A recurring theme throughout the report is the importance
of pursuing deeper regional integration within
the African continent (preferably a CFTA). This move
would strongly stimulate intra-African trade and help
in the movement toward more industrialized economies.<br><br>
It would also help African countries be more
competitive in the face of external trade agreements
that will increase competition for African export destinations
both on and away from the continent. Achieving
a CFTA would likely call for an increase in aid for
trade directed toward trade facilitation measures. African
governments should prioritize a CFTA and encourage
their development partners to assist with this
as well. The U.S. should consider scaling efforts aimed
at trade facilitation and officially integrating a comprehensive
trade assistance strategy as part of AGOA.<br><br>
This is particularly important as AGOA has two components:
trade and investment. While both components
are distinct, they also go hand in hand, because
strengthening one can help strengthen the other. <br><br>

	<hr><br>
	
Data and Modeling<br><br>
The scenarios in this report were modeled using
a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model.<br><br>
Although they have significant constraints/
limitations, CGE models are the sole tools available
today capable of capturing multiple interactions
taking place within the different agents of the world
economy, thanks to many interconnected equations
representing behaviors of economic agents
and various economic linkages. A CGE model uses
economic data to predict how economies react to
changes in policy, in this case, how U.S.-Africa
trade patterns react to changes in trade policy. In
other words, it compares the changes between any
scenario (after implementation of specific policy reforms)
and the reference case (or baseline), which
usually correspond to a prolongation of the current
situation.<br><br>
The CGE model used for this report is the MIRAGE
model, which stands for Modeling International
Relationships in Applied General Equilibrium. The
model is described as a multicountry, multisector,
recursive dynamic model.34 It was first developed to
analyze and study trade policy scenarios like bilateral
and multilateral agreements, which is why it is especially
useful for modeling the scenarios in this report.<br><br>
The CGE model generates indicators for regions that
allow it to measure the effects of changes related to
trade policy, including changes in exports, imports,
terms of trade, real GDP, real income and production
factor uses, among many other indicators.<br><br>

The data used for the model comes from the Global
Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) 7 database, and
the Market Access Map version 2 database, which
uses the six-digit Harmonized System (MAc-
Map-HS6v2). The GTAP database contains complete
bilateral trade information as well as transportation
and protection linkages between 113<br><br>
regions for 57 sectors. These data were paired with
the MAcMap tariff data because MAcMap gives
more exhaustive information on tariff lines than
the GTAP data, including ad valorem tariffs, specific
tariffs and preferences.35 MAcMap has data
for 169 countries, 220 trading partners and 5,113
HS6 products. MAcMap also provides a group of
reference weights, which allows for more accurate
demonstration and weighting of tariff and protection
data when aggregating tariff information across
countries and sectors.<br><br>
The data depict the global economy in 2004, but
they have been updated to reflect protection information
as of April 2013, since a number of significant
events and policy changes have taken place
since that time. Relevant protection information
regarding the most recent AGOA-eligible tariff lines
inclusive of textile and apparel clauses, the GSP tariff
lines and eligible countries, the Everything But
Arms trade preference of the European Union and
the expiration of the Multi-Fibre Arrangement have
all been taken into account.<br><br>

Country/Region Classifications<br><br>
For this report, unless otherwise indicated, the focus
of the modeling results was on the countries
of Africa, specifically the AGOA-eligible countries,
and the United States. In scenarios where the EU
was involved the effects of trade, involving the EU
was also examined. There are multiple scenarios
that involve other LDCs, and the results of the
trade policies involving them are relevant in those
scenarios.<br><br>
It should be noted that AGOA-eligible countries
included in the study lists Sudan, although Sudan is
not eligible for AGOA. South Sudan does not have
sufficient data available, thus Sudan as one country
serves as a proxy.<br><br>
The annexes include a list of the categorizations of
the countries (see annex T). Due to existing groupings
in the data, certain countries did not have individual
data available and thus were analyzed as a regional
group with other nearby countries. In some
cases, countries in one group crossed income levels,
and they were then classified as “rest of least-developed
countries,” which includes some non-LDCs
(because it is impossible to isolate only LDCs). The
one exception is Yemen, which is actually in a group
with many middle-income developing countries of
the Middle East and and is included in the group
“rest of developing countries.”<br><br>
Throughout the paper, different regional labels
apply. The “rest of West Africa” includes Benin,
Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Cote d’Ivoire, Gambia,
Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali,
Mauritania, Niger, Sierra Leone and Togo. The “rest
of Central Africa” includes Cameroon, Central African
Republic, Chad, Congo, Equatorial Guinea,
Gabon, and Sao Tome and Principe. The “rest of
Eastern Africa” includes Burundi, Comoros, Djibouti,
Eritrea, Kenya, Rwanda, Seychelles, Somalia
and Sudan (South Sudan is part of Sudan in the
GTAP database). The “rest of the Southern African
Customs Union (SACU)” includes Lesotho, Namibia
and Swaziland.<br><br>

Sectoral Classifications<br><br>
Commodities were placed into one of five broad
categories for analysis: agriculture and food; mining
and energy; textiles and apparel; other industry; and
services. The data breakdown used for the modeling
has information for 21 commodity sectors in total,
and the broader commodity categories were constructed
from these to provide broader overviews of
the trends. A complete list of the sectors and categories
can be found in annex S.<br><br>
Import-Sensitive Products and Index<br><br>
For scenarios B and C in category II as well as scenarios
A and B in category V, an index was used to
identify the commodities that are thought to be import
sensitive for the country receiving the goods.36
This index stipulates that commodities or sectors
that are usually import sensitive are those which
have high initial tariffs, which are highly traded,
and would have a high tariff reduction if the tariffs
were to be cut. Therefore, higher values of computed
index correspond to highly sensitive products.
Economic Partnership Agreements: Country
Groupings<br><br>
The EPAs in the West Africa region include Benin,
Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Cote d’Ivoire, the
Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia,
Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Togo
and Mauritania―almost the exact same countries
as the Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS) except for the inclusion of Mauritania.
The EPAs in the Central Africa region include
Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad,
the Republic of the Congo, the DRC, Equatorial
Guinea, Gabon, and Sao Tome and Principe―six
of these eight countries (Cameroon, the Central
African Republic, Chad, the Republic of the Congo,
Equatorial Guinea and Gabon) are part of the
regional economic group called la Communaute
Economique et Monetaire de l’Afrique Centrale (in
English, the Economic and Monetary Community
of Central Africa) and use the same currency.<br><br>

The East and Southern Africa region includes a variety
of countries that are not in a closely established
regional group and are not located in especially close
proximity to one another. They include the Indian
Ocean islands (Comoros, Madagascar, Mauritius
and Seychelles) and the countries on the Horn of
Africa (Djibouti, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Sudan), as
well as Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Interestingly,
the group labeled SADC includes only some
of the countries that are actually part of that regional
economic community, namely, Angola, Botswana,
Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland
and South Africa. The other members of SADC are
the DRC, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Zambia
and Zimbabwe, which have been placed into different
EPA regional groups. The only group that
involves all the members of an already-established
and well-integrated regional economic community
is the EAC, which contains Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania,
Burundi and Rwanda.<br><br>
The EU-U.S. Free Trade Agreement<br><br>
For the situation involving the possible EU-U.S.
FTA, the most recent round of WTO negotiations was used in the assumptions of the FTA’s design.
The EU-U.S. FTA model assumes that there would
be no tariffs on 100 percent of industry related
commodities. Of the 677 agricultural commodities
(at the HS-6 level), it is anticipated that certain levels
of protection would remain in place for the 4
percent most sensitive import items.<br><br>
For those 4 percent sensitive products, proposed
negotiated tariff rate cuts were used in the model.
For tariffs that were between 0 and greater than or
equal to 20 percent, then the 50 percent cut that one
would expect for a WTO-negotiated tariff would
be cut by two-thirds. For those between 20 and less
than 50 percent, then it would be two-thirds of the
57 percent cut; for those between 50 and less than
75 percent, then it would be two-thirds of the 64
percent cut; and for those greater than 75 percent,
it would be two-thirds of the 70 percent cut. In instances
where the most-favored-nation (MFN) tariff
rate would be lower than the sensitive tariff cuts,
then the MFN tariff rate would remain in place.<br><br>
