When Xi Jinping assumed his position as the new face of the Chinese leadership in November 2012, the optimism was palpable. Emerging from what some considered to be a “lost decade” under the leadership of Hu Jintao, China was ready for a new approach to steering the Middle Kingdom’s continued global rise. In his first days, Xi earned deserved praise at home and abroad as he embarked on an anti-corruption campaign, called on officials to use plain language and avoid ostentation, proclaimed the ultimate importance of the rule of law, and followed in Deng Xiaoping’s economic reformist footsteps by traveling south to Shenzhen, the site of China’s first special economic zone. <br><br>

As Xi’s honeymoon has progressed, however, the initial deluge of optimism has slowed to a trickle. Many watchers of the Chinese leadership have become dispirited by a lack of substantive progress toward much-needed political reform, while Chinese public intellectuals have been dismayed by orders instructing them not to speak about seven sensitive issues: universal values, freedom of the press, civil society, civil rights, past mistakes by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), crony capitalism, and judicial independence. Media censorship has tightened, and participants in human rights activities have encountered increasing political harassment and even arrest. <br><br>

In an attempt to consolidate his footing among party conservatives, Xi in July traveled to Xibaipo village, the People’s Liberation Army headquarters at the end of the civil war, where he quoted Mao Zedong to bolster Communist spirit. Following his trip, the leadership launched an effort to bar construction of new government buildings for the next five years. As Xi works to revitalize his image, he continues to favor superficial party controls and propaganda over substantive political and judicial reform. <br><br>

Cognizant that his ideas did not fully catch on initially―with officials turning to online shopping and secret dining clubs to avoid being seen consuming in public, and with citizens expressing cynicism about the government’s anti-corruption rhetoric―Xi appears to realize that his political capital is waning and his honeymoon is reaching its end. Equally important, China’s economic slowdown has prompted growing concerns about the ability of the new leadership to deliver on its promises. This climate has roused Xi’s sense of urgency to adopt more liberal economic policies, stimulate China’s weakening growth, and regain the confidence of his wary fellow leaders and the middle class at large. <br><br>

Xi is not the only Chinese leader in recent decades to have entered office facing high expectations in the realms of political and economic reform. His predecessors discovered that economic reforms were easier to pursue than political reforms. Xi now confronts this same reality, yet he also faces deeper and rougher political waters than any Chinese leader since Mao, with the very survival of the party-state resting in his hands. <br><br>

Despite these dire circumstances, the economic reforms wrought by his predecessors have nurtured in Xi and other leaders of his generation great confidence in their economic management skills, as they have helped shape China into the world’s second-biggest economy. Those same reforms have also bred a rapidly growing middle class that now holds greater consumer power and higher levels of education, and makes more political demands, than ever before. <br><br>

As these trends converge at a political crossroads, will Xi be able to utilize his team’s economic skills to implement reforms that both please the middle class and break the political bottleneck? Can further economic reforms succeed without any accompanying political reforms? It is vitally important for the Chinese to explore these questions surrounding Xi’s politically conservative, economically liberal approach to governing while there is still time to change course.<br><br>

ELITISTS AND POPULISTS

The leadership transition of 2012C13 brought the promotion and retention of experienced economic reformers, in addition to the exclusion of a couple of political reformCminded heavyweights from top leadership positions. Although this once-a-decade power transfer usually takes place behind closed doors, stained by backroom deal making, the most recent transition was muddied more than usual by major political scandals. Yet, even as uncertainty surrounded the leadership selection and the country’s political trajectory, one policy goal remained clear: Economic reform would endure as a priority. <br><br>

As in any society, the identities of the political players help shape the policies they will implement. China is a one-party state, but this does not necessarily mean that the leadership is monolithic. On the contrary, China’s leadership can be divided into two informal but well-known coalitions: the “elitist coalition,” which emerged during the era of former President Jiang Zemin, and the “populist coalition,” once headed by former President Hu. The top two current leaders, President Xi and Prime Minister Li Keqiang, now head these two coalitions, respectively. This informal division of power is sometimes referred to as the “one party, two coalitions” political mechanism. <br><br>

The two coalitions represent different socioeconomic and geographical constituencies and differ in expertise, credentials, and experience. Most of the top leaders in the elitist coalition, for instance, are “princelings” from families of veteran revolutionaries and high-ranking officials. Princelings often began their careers in rich and economically well-developed coastal cities. The elitist coalition usually represents the interests of China’s business elites, especially the state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and the vast majority of the emerging middle class. <br><br>

Most of the populist coalition’s leading figures, by contrast, come from less-privileged families and tend to have accumulated much of their leadership experience in less-developed inland provinces. Many of these leaders began their climbs up the political ladder through leadership in the Chinese Communist Youth League and are known as tuanpai (League faction). The populists often voice the concerns of vulnerable social groups such as farmers, migrant workers, and the urban poor. <br><br>

More than any other leadership organization, the makeup of the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC), China’s top ruling body, will determine the direction and pace of the next phase of economic reform, as well as the arc of sociopolitical change in the country. In this latest leadership changeover, only one of the seven top leaders in the PSC―Prime Minister Li―represents the populist coalition, while the other six are all protégés of Jiang. However, the balance between the two camps on the Politburo and the Central Military Commission has largely stayed intact, and many of Hu’s people made it onto the 376-member Central Committee. In any case, the dominance of elitists on the PSC reduces the chance for policy deadlock as a result of factional infighting, giving Xi tremendous power to carry out his policy objectives.<br><br>

MARKET FRIENDLY<br><br>

Although the strong presence of princelings in the top leadership likely will reinforce public perceptions of the convergence of power and wealth in the country, the four princeling leaders on the PSC―Xi, Zhang Dejiang, Yu Zhengsheng, and Wang Qishan―all have decades of experience leading China’s major cities and provinces, and are highly competent in economic and financial affairs. Some Chinese analysts argue that, due to their princeling background, these leaders have more political capital and resources than did their predecessors Hu and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao (who came from humble family backgrounds) in terms of running the Chinese economy and coordinating various governmental agencies.<br><br>

Xi has long been known for his market-friendly approach to economic development for domestic and foreign businesses alike. Xi’s experience leading Fujian, Zhejiang, and Shanghai, three economically advanced regions, has prepared him well to promote the development of the private sector, foreign investment and trade, and the liberalization of China’s financial system―all of which experienced serious setbacks under the previous administration.<br><br>

Another example of effective leadership is Wang Qishan, now serving as the anticorruption czar. Over the past few years Wang served as a principal convener in the Sino-US Strategic and Economic Dialogue. Wang, whose nickname is “chief of the fire brigade,” is arguably the most competent policy maker in economic and financial affairs in the Chinese leadership. The public regards him as capable and trustworthy during times of emergency or crisis, whether it be the country’s response to the 1997C98 Asian financial crisis, the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic, or ongoing rampant official corruption. Wang likely will promote the continued development of foreign investment and trade, the liberalization of the financial system, tight control of government spending, and tax revenue reforms, all of which are crucial for maintaining smooth central-local economic relations.<br><br>

The members of this PSC are clearly interested in economic reform, but their views regarding political reform are notably conservative. For proponents of political reform, the exclusion from the PSC of two key liberals, Vice President Li Yuanchao and Vice Prime Minister Wang Yang, was a setback. Wang Yang lost out because many conservative leaders saw him as a threat.<br><br>

His main political rival was Bo Xilai, before Bo’s dramatic fall in 2012. As Bo succumbed to political scandal, the conservatives clearly wanted to exclude Wang. That Li Yuanchao also did not get promoted, however, was surprising to many. An instrumental voice for liberal intellectuals who demand the rule of law, governmental accountability, and intra-party democracy, Li has many supporters. Both of these tuanpai leaders will still meet age eligibility requirements for the next PSC in 2017.<br><br>

TECHNOCRATS IN CHARGE<br><br>

Beyond the PSC, Xi has recruited or retained a capable and well-regarded team to shepherd monetary and fiscal policy reforms at the ministry level. The team includes an impressive mix of experienced economic technocrats, including Zhou Xiaochuan, Lou Jiwei, and Liu He. Zhou has become the longest serving governor of the People’s Bank of China, which he has led since 2002 and to which he was reappointed this year. Zhou has participated in economic reforms since the 1990s and has been an assertive advocate of further liberalizing the financial sector. He has helped transform the struggling state-owned banks into commercial lenders, accelerate the opening of the capital account, and loosen restrictions on the Chinese currency.<br><br>

Lou, appointed finance minister this year, has also been active in economic reform since the 1990s, when he was a critical player in the transformation of China’s tax system and planning for a domestic bond market. A protégé of former Prime Minister Zhu Rongji, Lou served as vice minister of finance from 1998 to 2007, and gained international attention in 2007 when he was appointed chairman and CEO of the start-up China Investment Corporation, becoming one of the most powerful fund managers in the world. In charge of that $200 billion sovereign wealth fund, he was tasked with generating higher returns for the country in the midst of the world economy’s downturn.<br><br>

Finally, Liu, the new deputy director of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), will also take on the powerful role of director of the Office of the Central Leading Group on Financial and Economic Affairs. A graduate of Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, Liu began his work on China’s economic policy in the 1990s, when he helped shape China’s five-year plans at the State Development Planning Commission (today’s NDRC). As one of the most influential economists of his generation and a proponent of financial liberalization, Liu served as a major collaborator in a World Bank report published in 2012 that advocated market-driven change to constrain SOE monopolies. Now, as a key player in financial policy over the coming years, he will help lead the attempted structural transformation from an export-driven economy to a domestic consumptionCdriven economy. <br><br>

Together, these leaders could combine experience with innovation to help accelerate this transformation, and their patrons on the PSC will support this trajectory. It is particularly encouraging that this team of economic technocrats is planning a comprehensive economic reform agenda that includes financial liberalization, central-local tax reform, pricing reform, greater incentives for private sector development, deregulation, SOE reform, land use rights, and more accommodating policies for rural-urban migration, among other measures. Some of these liberal economic policies have already been adopted, and more likely will be approved at the CCP’s Third Plenary meeting in October. <br><br>

REFORM TENSIONS<br><br>

Such an economic reformCminded and experienced group of policy makers could not have been elevated to positions of power at a more opportune time. It will take such an accomplished team to steer China through the deep, rough waters ahead. From a chaotic urbanization push, a housing bubble, and an impending banking crisis to a falling GDP growth rate and persistent college graduate unemployment, the need for innovative policy making is clear. Over his first year in office, Xi has set the stage for economic reform through his actions and statements, and a growing sense of crisis will compel the leadership to embark on these reforms with a sense of urgency.<br><br>

Nonetheless, the tensions within Xi’s politically conservative, economically liberal approach to governing mirror those confronted by his predecessors, who always seemed to take one step forward economically while taking a step backward politically. During his famous “southern tour” in 1992, Deng called for greater market reform and economic privatization, while continuing to crack down on political dissent. Jiang broadened the CCP’s power base by recruiting entrepreneurs and other new socioeconomic players (a formulation known as the “three represents”), while launching a harsh political campaign against the Falun Gong, an emerging group of religious believers. Hu’s populist appeal for a “harmonious society” sought to reduce economic disparities and social tensions while he tightened censorship over the media and police control of society, especially in ethnic minority regions. In all of these major socioeconomic and political developments, the CCP leadership made a calculated but far reaching ideological and policy move in one area, but resisted political pressure in another. <br><br>

Xi’s recent pronouncement of the “Chinese dream” presented the slogan that will likely encapsulate his time in the leadership and serve as the objective by which he hopes to be judged in history books. In his vague explanation of the Chinese dream, Xi paired nationalistic sentiment (or national rejuvenation) with an economically liberal desire to accommodate the wants and needs of a middle class lifestyle, also implying an equal opportunity for all Chinese to rise to middle class status. When Xi held his first summit with President Barack Obama in June 2013, he expanded on the definition of the Chinese dream, highlighting its similarity to the American dream and calling for “economic prosperity, national rejuvenation, and people’s well-being.” While the official meaning of the Chinese dream has become better defined over time, CCP conservative leaders have strongly rejected the notion it might include dreams of constitutionalism and political democracy.<br><br>

The Chinese people, hearing these ambiguous messages emanating from the leadership and state run media, do not know whom to trust. Forced to turn to social media for unfiltered (albeit often censored) news, they continue to express feelings of deep political uncertainty and fear for their country’s socioeconomic stability. Many wonder how they can realize a Chinese dream when their country is facing declining economic prospects, especially when they have economic statistics to validate their concerns. China’s economic growth rate slowed from 9.3 percent in 2011 to 7.8 percent last year, the lowest growth rate since 1999. In 2013, debates have raged over whether the country will even be able to reach its initial 7.5 percent growth target.<br><br>

At the same time, China’s Gini coefficient, which measures economic inequality (with zero representing perfect equality and 1 representing perfect inequality), continues to far exceed the 0.44 threshold generally thought to indicate potential for social destabilization. Independent estimates have shown the figure rising to 0.47 in 2009 and 0.61 in 2010, significantly surpassing official government estimates. In an attempt to measure official corruption, the Washington-based group Global Financial Integrity has shown that cumulative illicit financial flows from China totaled $3.8 trillion from 2000 to 2011. Facing these dire economic trends, the leadership cannot afford to vacillate: The time has come for bolder, more comprehensive action. <br><br>

CONFLICTING INTERESTS<br><br>

As he seeks to impose his Chinese dream on concerned Chinese citizens (while confronting liberal intellectuals who have become increasingly skeptical of the concept), Xi will also have to navigate a murky political climate. When Xi first took office, Hu’s unpopularity among opinion leaders and the middle class initially enhanced Xi’s public support―giving the sense that he had a new mandate. Furthermore, in the wake of the Bo Xilai scandal, all party elites regardless of factional affiliation united under Xi’s leadership in order to defend CCP rule. But will the leadership remain united and retain the fortitude necessary to enact meaningful economic reforms while balancing the demands of interest groups?<br><br>

Xi’s leadership team has strong incentives to embrace economic reforms. On the one hand, successful reform will greatly enhance the public’s confidence in the CCP, providing the leadership with the political capital to confront many other problems in Chinese society. On the other hand, failure to act will increase the likelihood of domestic instability (and potentially a bottom-up revolution). <br><br>

Despite these incentives, there are many external factors that could come into play and erode the support for Xi’s factional majority on the PSC or the leadership’s inherent interest in economic reform. It remains possible that new political scandals, economic crises, environmental disasters, or public health hazards might emerge and affect China’s political climate. As we learned from the spate of events that preceded the 18th Party Congress last year, including the purge of Bo, the demotion of Hu’s chief of staff, and a New York Times report accusing Wen’s family of corruption, timing is everything. <br><br>

However, beyond unpredictable events and continuing intra-party machinations, the greatest obstacles to economic reform are the companies that are part of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC), which accounted for 43 percent of China’s GDP in 2012. The formidable power of this group explains why it took 13 years for China to pass an anti-monopoly law, why the macroeconomic control policy of the past decade was largely ineffective, and why the widely acknowledged property bubble has continued to grow. In each of these cases, corporate and industrial interest groups have encroached on the governmental decision-making process, either by inducing policy deadlock or manipulating policies in their favor.<br><br>

Under the SASAC, various players associated with property development have emerged as one of the most powerful special interest groups in present-day China. According to official state accounts, more than 70 percent of the total of 120 SASAC companies engaged in the real estate business and property development in 2010. In response, the State Council ordered 78 SASAC companies to withdraw their real estate investments. But resistance from these companies made the government order largely ineffective. In the first half of 2013, SASAC companies saw their profits increase by 18.2 percent over 2012. This profitable trend will only increase tensions surrounding new market-oriented policies.<br><br>

Pressure from these powerful and well-connected SASAC companies, however, will not be enough to derail economic reform. Other interest groups―primarily made up of members of the rising middle class who hold a negative impression of SOEs―will also weigh heavily on the minds of the leadership. For example, college graduates, who often come from middle class families, continue to face a high unemployment rate, with nearly two million failing to find work each year. A shrinking private sector has alerted the middle class to the increasingly obvious oligarchic power of SOEs and their inability to innovate.<br><br>

Indeed, a study conducted by Chinese scholars shows that the profits made by China’s 500 largest private companies in 2009 amounted to less than the total revenues of just two SOE firms, China Mobile and Sinopec. With no incentive to innovate, these and other SOE monopolies will continue to hamper China’s economic growth, severely undermining the leadership’s effort to generate an innovation-led and consumption-driven economy. As potent and profitable SOEs push back against reform, and the middle class pushes back against them, the ultimate shape of the economic reforms will reveal which group holds the real economic and sociopolitical upper hand in society: state-owned corporations or the middle class. <br><br>

POLITICAL PERILS<br><br>

Even with varied interest groups holding sway over the eventual outcome, China’s leadership is poised to adopt some economic reforms to promote the private sector. But SOEs are not the only obstacles the country faces. The road ahead is also far from certain because of the leadership’s ambivalence toward―or outright avoidance of―discussions of the political reform that must accompany any successful economic reform effort. Just as past economic reforms bred the need for current economic reforms, economic transformation today will breed the need for political reform tomorrow.<br><br>

Both China’s emerging middle class and its lower class have taken note of the economic problems that arise from a closed political environment. A truly innovation-driven economy requires political openness, just as a service sectorCled economy requires a developed legal system, the rule of law, and the ability to contain widespread official corruption. As China’s economy undergoes the transformation from an export-driven to a consumption-driven model, the middle class likely will sit in the driver’s seat of economic development. Adopting political as well as economic policies that please those economic drivers is the key to ensuring a smoother economic transformation.<br><br>

No group in Chinese society better exemplifies the conundrum of the government’s development policies than the middle class. Born from the economic reforms of the past, the middle class believes its interests have been ignored by the government for too long. Even if members of the middle class obtain the resources to consume everything they desire, they will ultimately want a say in what the future holds for them. Recent studies conducted in China have found that the middle class, more than other social groups, tends to be cynical about the policy promises made by authorities, more demanding of policy implementation, and more sensitive when it comes to official corruption. As middle class Chinese realize that their voices are being suppressed, that their access to information is being blocked, and that their space for social action is being unduly confined, increased political dissent may take shape.<br><br>

Even beyond the middle class, vulnerable social groups have begun to express dissatisfaction with their inability to achieve the middle class lifestyle. The manual labor shortage that has hit some coastal cities in recent years reflects a growing awareness of individual rights among these vulnerable groups. Migrant workers have shown a willingness to move from job to job seeking better pay, yet China’s urbanization policy is markedly unaccommodating to migrants. As they see middle class families with multiple homes and corrupt officials or rich entrepreneurs buying costly villas for their mistresses, their discontent will only continue to mount.<br><br>

In recent years, these disgruntled groups have given the leadership a taste of what the future will hold if it continues to avoid political reform, often turning to organizing “mass incidents” (protests involving more than 100 participants)―more than 100,000 of which occur each year, according to official estimates. These protests arise from a number of factors, including social dislocation, political injustice, lack of work safety or job security, inadequacy of consumer rights, environmental degradation, and problems associated with internal migration.<br><br>

The cost of “maintaining social stability” (weiwen), primarily through the police force, has become astonishingly high. The Chinese government’s official budget for national defense in 2012 was 670.3 billion renminbi (about $109 billion), while the budget for police and public security was 701.8 billion renminbi (more than $114 billion) Clearly, the regime could save a great deal of money if it were to provide the people forums in which to express their concerns instead of leaving them little choice except public protest.<br><br>

To regain the public’s confidence and avoid a bottom-up revolution, the CCP must embrace genuine and systematic democratic change. The following profound political reforms need to be made. First, legal reforms―including the realization of judiciary reform, the rule of law, and constitutionalism―are essential. The scandals of the past few years have shown leaders that legal reform is the best way to protect all citizens, including themselves, in a country that still lacks the rule of law. It will take decades for China to construct a constitutional system, but before long the party should make the ideological, political, and legal statement that it serves under, rather than above, the constitution.<br><br>

Second, media regulation is in urgent need of reform. Social media have become so powerful that the Chinese authorities often shut down domestic microblogging services. This is not an effective way to run the country (especially when innovation is supposed to be driving the economy). The reason people rely on social media for news is that the mainstream media are not particularly informative or trustworthy. Thus, the way to avoid the sensationalism produced by social media is to open up the mainstream media. Leaders should realize that the more sensational stories are suppressed, the more powerful such stories become.<br><br>

Third, the CCP should pursue bolder intra-party elections, which could involve voting as a means of assigning leadership positions. The nature of collective leadership will likely encourage factional politics. Yet China’s emerging balance of power between the elitist and the populist coalitions should prevent the zero-sum games of the past, in which the winner takes all in elite competition. Incorporating intra-party elections into elite selection will help increase party legitimacy.<br><br>

WINDOW CLOSING?<br><br>

The costs and risks of not delivering such reasonable reforms will only grow in the years ahead. As China’s leaders engage in discussions about the country’s falling economic growth rate, the housing bubble, and the banking crisis, they may believe―rightly―that they hold the keys (and they have the experience) to bring about essential transformations. They also have the support of a rising middle class eager for SOE reform, tax cuts, and assurances that their housing investments are safe. But at the same time, the leaders must realize that without gradual but bold reform of the legal system, media openness, and a more accountable and representative political structure, the next phase of economic reform will not go far.<br><br> 

As the window closes on their politically conservative, economically liberal approach to governing, Xi and his team should embrace this moment to stand on the right side of history. October’s Third Plenary meeting of the 18th Central Committee, traditionally an occasion when leaders have taken the opportunity to break with the past, provides the perfect opportunity. After failing to boost public confidence and deliver sound economic policies at their first two major meetings, the leadership needs to use the Third Plenary meeting to begin crossing the deep waters of reform and avoid drowning. Until China’s leaders take this essential step toward embracing gradual political reform as part of a larger reform plan, Xi’s hope for national rejuvenation will remain nothing more than a pipe dream.<br><br>

Beijing’s Caution on Reforms Makes Sense C For Now <br><br>

By: Eswar Prasad<br><br>
A big-bang approach might harm the cause of reform in the long term by inviting stronger opposition from those keen to maintain the status quo.<br><br>

Cataloguing China’s economic risks has become a popular parlour game. In the past decade, a steady drumbeat of warnings has predicted imminent collapse. Rising state and local government debt, a weak financial system and multiplying inefficiencies in the economy certainly pose big risks. The reforms needed to maintain growth and improve its quality have been painfully slow.<br><br>

Despite these problems, the size of China’s economy and the per capita income of its citizens have quadrupled in the past 15 years, pulling millions out of poverty. Still, the country cannot outrun its problems forever. Unbalanced growth has led to widening inequality and environmental degradation.<br><br>

China’s leaders often talk of the need for broad reforms but their actions are, critics say, plodding and hypercautious. This issue is in the spotlight as expectation builds that next month’s party plenum in Beijing will yield a range of reforms. Some warn, however, that such hopes will be disappointed.<br><br>

Yet, for all the criticism, certain aspects of China’s cautious approach to economic reforms, which is likely to continue, might actually prove an object lesson to other countries.<br><br>

Consider the proposal to eliminate the ceiling on interest rates paid on bank deposits. The ceiling has stifled competition among lenders, resulting in households receiving minuscule real returns on their deposits for much of the past decade.<br><br>

Removing the ceiling would have its dangers. Weaker, poorly regulated banks might offer higher rates to compete for deposits, make riskier loans and set themselves up for failure. An explicit deposit insurance system, rather than the implicit state guarantee that now covers all deposits, would impose market discipline.<br><br>

Since such a system would take time to put in place, the government has chipped away at the ceiling by allowing the proliferation of other saving products with higher returns. This approach has its own risks but helps catalyse interest rate reforms.<br><br>

Small, indirect changes, even if inefficient, elicit less opposition, pose fewer risks and make course corrections easier. A big-bang approach might harm the cause of reform in the long term by inviting stronger opposition from those keen to maintain the status quo.<br><br>

Many countries have undertaken big changes when they face a crisis; reforms are harder without such pressure as they invariably involve disruption and risks. The rhetoric surrounding proposed measures then turns out to be crucial in determining their political fate. In the US, the benefits of the Affordable Care Act have been subverted by the false narrative that it would socialise healthcare and destroy jobs.<br><br>

In emerging markets, the notion that reforms benefit the economic and political elite is a powerful obstacle. Foreign investment in India’s retail sector has been stymied by the narrative that it profits global corporations, destroying small retailers’ livelihoods. In reality, it would help the poor by improving food distribution channels, reducing waste and keeping costs down.<br><br>

Beijing has proved effective at creating narratives that build broad support and provide a framework for communicating the logic and desirability of individual reforms.<br><br>

Given its under-developed financial markets, capital account liberalisation would be premature. But this objective highlights areas where reforms would be in China’s own interest: broader and better regulated financial markets, as well as a more flexible exchange rate.<br><br>

This year, Beijing announced a plan to reduce inequality. This would be a dubious policy goal if it emphasised redistributive policies. In fact, the proposals are exactly the reforms needed C financial market liberalisation, reform of state-owned enterprises and freer labour mobility. All are worthy in themselves but the narrative helped emphasise that the benefits would be widespread rather than accruing to the select few.<br><br>

Narratives must be translated into action. China does not have the luxury to postpone all reforms until the conditions are ripe. Its leadership may have to take greater risks to advance much-needed steps. But critics should appreciate that Beijing’s approach might reflect its economic and political savviness rather than a lack of commitment.<br><br>

Tiger Hunt in China’s Oil Patch: Why Are So Many Former Oil Executives Under Investigation? <br><br>


One week after the conclusion of the trial of former Chinese Communist Party (CCP) heavyweight Bo Xilai, a new political drama involving money and power (but so far neither sex nor murder) began to unfold in Beijing. During the last week of August, the CCP’s Central Discipline and Inspection Committee (CDIC) announced that four executives at China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) C which ranks number five on the Fortune Global 500 list for 2013 and is one of China’s most profitable and powerful state-owned enterprises C were under investigation for disciplinary violations. On September 1, the CDIC announced that it was investigating an even more prominent individual C Jiang Jiemin, the director of the State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC), which is the controlling shareholder in the approximately 100 enterprises in strategic industries ranging from automobiles to petroleum to telecommunications that are owned by the Chinese government. Jiang, a career oil man, held top jobs at CNPC in the late 2000s, including chairman of CNPC’s internationally-listed subsidiary, PetroChina, from 2011 to 2013, from which he assumed the top position at SASAC. All five individuals were subsequently removed from their posts.<br><br>

The investigations into Jiang and the quartet of CNPC executives (“the CNPC investigations”) have generated much speculation inside and outside of China about the purpose of the probe. Three of the leading hypotheses under discussion include cracking down on corruption, weakening vested interests and punishing recently retired Politburo Standing Committee (PBSC) member Zhou Yongkang, another career oil man who oversaw China’s domestic security from 2007-2012. These hypotheses are not mutually exclusive.<br><br>

Hypothesis 1: The CNPC investigations are aimed at cracking down on corruption.<br><br>

The CCP has indicated that the investigations are about corruption.  The reason given by the CDIC for the investigations into Jiang and each of the CNPC executives was “serious violations of discipline,” which often refers to corruption. In addition, a Politburo meeting convened on August 27 stressed the importance of both punishing and preventing corruption.[1]Since then, Chinese media reports have begun to provide information on alleged incidents of graft at CNPC and the inquiries into wrongdoing at the company.[2]<br><br>

CNPC was probably an appealing target because the excesses of Chinese oil companies have been widely criticized by the Chinese public. CNPC’s domestic peer, China Petrochemical Corporation (Sinopec), was previously a poster child for oil executives behaving badly.  In 2007, former Sinopec chairman Chen Tonghai, who reportedly charged almost $6000 per day in personal expenses, was removed from his post on charges of corruption and subsequently convicted of accepting bribes, for which he is now imprisoned.[3]In 2011, invoices detailing liquor purchases of nearly $450,000, including some very expensive bottles of French wine, by Sinopec’s Guangdgong branch appeared on the internet, prompting some Chinese netizens to draw a link between the “astronomically-priced” liquor bill and the higher prices they were paying at the pump.[4] 
<br><br>
The probe into graft at CNPC is part of CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping's anti-corruption drive. When he took over the top spot in the CCP in November 2012, he warned that corruption posed a grave threat to the Party.[5] The CNPC investigations indicate that Xi is making good on his promise to go after both flies (low-level crooks) and tigers (high-level crooks). Jiang is one of several tigers who have been trapped by Xi. The others include Liu Tienan, the former director of the National Energy Administration, and Xu Long, the former general manager of China Mobile’s Guangdong branch. <br><br>

Hypothesis 2: The CNPC investigations are aimed at gaining control over vested interests.<br><br>
The inquiry into graft at CNPC is a sign that Xi’s administration intends to take on vested interests likely to oppose reforms needed to move China's economy onto a more sustainable growth path which are expected to emerge at the Third Plenum in November. Prime Minister Li Keqiang indicated a willingness to tackle the problem of vested interests in his first remarks as Prime Minister in March, when he stated that "stirring up vested interests is more difficult than stirring up one's soul. But no matter how deep the water is, we must wade through because we don't have any other options -- it's our nation's fate and future that are at stake."[6] The CNPC investigations are a plunge into the deep water; it's hard to find an interest group with more at stake in the current system than the oil industry.<br><br>


CNPC, Sinopec and China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) have benefited tremendously from the status quo. They monopolize China's oil market, enjoy access to top leaders, and influence policy, sometimes advancing corporate interests at the expense of national ones. The wealth -- and arguably the power -- of the oil companies and their senior managers has grown over the past decade thanks not only to their monopoly but also to sustained high oil prices and low dividend payout rates. Indeed, one of the reasons for the reshuffling of top executives at the three oil companies in April 2011 -- and the establishment of boards of directors at CNPC, Sinopec and CNOOC -- was to prevent the accumulation of too much power in the hands of the number one boss. (Interestingly, the rotation of the oil executives involved Jiang.)[7]<br><br>

Hypothesis 3: The CNPC investigations are aimed at punishing Zhou Yongkang.<br><br>
The ultimate target of the CNPC investigations is former Politburo Standing Committee member Zhou Yongkang. While it’s not exactly clear why Xi would go after Zhou, one popular explanation is that Xi is seeking to consolidate power at the apex of the Chinese party-state.[8] <br><br>
This argument is supported by the fact that CNPC is one of Zhou Yongkang’s two power bases where individuals are under investigation, some of whom have close ties to Zhou.  The other is Sichuan Province. <br><br>

Zhou Yongkang, who spent more than thirty years working in China’s oil industry, not only served as general manager of CNPC from 1996-1998, he also has personal connections to at least three of the CNPC executives under investigation.  The most important one is Jiang Jiemin. Jiang and Zhou worked together at the Shengli Petroleum Administration (which became part of SINOPEC in 1998), where Zhou was director general and party secretary from 1988 to 1996 and Jiang was deputy director from 1993-1994. Jiang is widely believed to be a protégé of Zhou, who promoted Jiang within CNPC.[9] The second is Li Hualin, who served as an assistant to Zhou at Shengli in the late 1980s.[10]<br><br>

At least two of the former officials under investigation in Sichuan Province, where Zhou served as party secretary from 1999-2002, also have ties to Zhou. The first is Guo Yongxiang, who was deputy secretary general of the Sichuan party committee from 2000 to 2002 and secretary general from 2002-2006.  He became the target of an investigation of the CCP’s Central Discipline and Inspection Committee for “serious violations of party discipline” in June 2013. Guo worked with Zhou between 1990 and 2002, first at Shengli, then at the Ministry of Land and Resources (where Zhou was Minister from 1998-1999) and finally in Sichuan. Guo’s career path suggests that he is a protégé of Zhou.[11]  The second is Li Chuncheng who was deputy party secretary of Sichuan Province from September 2011 until December 2012, when he became the subject of a CDIC investigation. Li also held several government and party positions in Sichuan while Zhou was provincial party secretary, and the two are widely reported to have been close associates.[12] <br><br>

If recent Chinese history is any guide, the investigations into the above individuals with ties to Zhou Yongkang may indicate that Zhou is the ultimate target. As Alice Miller explains in an essay in the Summer 2012 issue of the China Leadership Monitor, the takedowns of former Beijing party chief Chen Xitong in 1995 and former Shanghai party boss Chen Liangyu in 2006 both started with corruption investigations involving their subordinates.[13] However, it is worth noting that both Chens were Politburo members, whereas Zhou was a PBSC member; some analysts suspect that Zhou might be untouchable because he served on the PBSC.[14]<br><br>

What’s really going on?<br><br>

While we’re still in the early days of these probes, the simplest explanation C and the one which currently appears to have the most publicly available evidence to support it C is that the CNPC investigations are about what the CDIC indicated they are about: cracking down on corruption, which is an existential threat to the CCP.  The investigations may also be a means to other ends. One likely end is weakening vested interests likely to oppose reforms necessary to put the Chinese economy on a more sustainable growth path and to avoid the middle-income trap, which would also pose a threat to the CCP.  It is also possible that the investigations are targeting Zhou Yongkang since they involve individuals from his power bases. However, the other two hypotheses can explain the CNPC investigations without reference to Zhou. Unless and until the CDIC publicly announces an investigation into Zhou, it will be hard to say for sure if he is indeed one of the tigers being hunted by Xi. <br><br>

Issue Brief: Water Resource Issues, Policy and Politics in China <br><br>

By: Scott Moore<br><br>

Editor’s note: Scott Moore is Giorgio Ruffolo Doctoral Research Fellow at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, Harvard Kennedy School. He was a guest researcher at Brookings’ John L. Thornton China Center and Brookings-Tsinghua Center for Public Policy in the spring of 2012. His research project was made possible by the generous support of the Ford Foundation.<br><br>

Among the many challenges to China’s current economic development trajectory, water resource constraints are among the most worrisome. According to Barry Naughton, one of the foremost experts on the Chinese economy, “China’s greatest development challenges…are in the areas where a dense population pushes up against the limits of water and what the land can provide.”[1] The water resource challenge to China’s development is exceptionally complex, encompassing a blend of geographical, political, economic, and social dimensions. This Issue Brief describes the root causes of China’s water resource challenge, assesses the Chinese government’s policy response to date, and finally offers recommendations to increase the effectiveness of these policies.<br><br>

In short, China’s water resource challenge consists of both water quantity and quality issues, each of which present distinctive challenges for Chinese policy. Although the Chinese government is implementing perhaps the world’s most ambitious water resource management strategy, its efforts risk being undermined by inter-governmental rivalries, corruption, and incentives that favor economic development over sustainable resource use. In particular, inter-jurisdictional conflicts over water resources threaten to undermine policies to address water scarcity, while mis-matched incentives between pollution control and economic development at local levels of government threaten to undermine water quality control objectives.<br><br>

Plenty of water, in all the wrong places<br><br>

In aggregate, China possesses substantial water resources, constituting the world’s fifth-largest national endowment of fresh water. By per-capita standards, however, China’s water resources are much more modest at approximately 2000 cubic meters per person annually, as compared to a global average of about 6200 m3/person/year.[2] These aggregate statistics nonetheless conceal marked regional discrepancies in precipitation and irrigation patterns, which combined with uneven distributions in population and economic activity mean that some areas possess plentiful water resources while others face chronic and crippling shortages. While residents of the sparsely populated, mountainous southwest enjoy some 25,000 cubic meters of freshwater per person annually, those of the populous and arid north have less than 500.[3] Some of China’s largest and fastest-growing urban areas, notably Beijing and Tianjin, and its most water-intensive crops, especially wheat, are located and grown in the arid north, where annual precipitation is less than one-third of that in southern coastal areas. For the past few decades, water-stressed areas have relied on groundwater to make up the difference, but since at least the 1970s rates of withdrawal have become unsustainable, and water tables are dropping by approximately one meter annually throughout the North China Plain.[4] Apart from making water more difficult and expensive to access, over-pumping of freshwater allows saltwater to penetrate aquifers in some areas, rendering them unfit for human consumption.[5]<br><br>

Other factors exacerbate this fundamental geographic mal-distribution of water availability and demand. Climate change is expected to intensify aridity in northern China,[6] enhancing its scarcity of both surface and subsurface water supplies. Moreover, although the arid north depends on irrigated agriculture, its irrigation systems are exceptionally inefficient. Less than half the water withdrawn for irrigation actually reaches crops because of leaky equipment and rapid evaporation, while the overall economic productivity of water is about US$3.50 per cubic meter, compared to a developed-nation average of US$36.[7] Rising demand for water-intensive crops like wheat,[8] as well as other commodities which require large quantities of water to produce, process, and refine, further stress water resources. China’s coal use, in particular, contributes to its water scarcity challenges―independent estimates suggest that it takes between 800 and 3000 gallons of water to process a ton of coal.[9] China's largest coal basin stretches across five provinces in the North, and the scarcity of water there is already constraining production, especially for smaller, less-efficient mines. These growing pressures on water resources, particularly in north China, are of mounting concern to the Chinese government. The Vice-Minister for Water Resources confided last year that China faces an “increasingly grim” water scarcity situation.[10]<br><br>

The Chinese government has adopted two basic policy responses to the water scarcity problem. First, it has continued to finance the gigantic South-North Water Transfer Project, or SNWTP (Nanshui beidiao gongcheng 南水北调工程). The SNWTP eventually aims to transfer some 45 billion cubic meters of water per year from central and southwest China to augment the flow of the Yellow River and meet urban water demand in the Beijing-Tianjin region. The Project envisions eastern, central, and western routes, of which the first is under construction and the second in a stage of advanced planning. All three routes pose enormous technical challenges: the eastern and central routes will be channeled under the Yellow River, while the western route entails pumping water at elevations of 10-16,000 feet above sea level over part of the Himalayan mountain range.<br><br>

Although completion of the three routes is expected to meet projected water demand growth in the north, thus redressing China’s fundamental geographic disparity in water availability, its costs will be enormous. Estimates suggest a figure of around US$62 billion, the final cost is likely to be markedly higher. Moreover, estimates of the number of people who must be resettled range from several hundreds of thousands to over a million, adding substantial social disruption to the Project’s total cost.[11] Moreover, the SNWTP has necessitated additional water diversion and storage works to bring water into regions tapped to export water to the north, as well as treatment facilities to ensure that the water is clean enough to supply drinking water to northern cities.[12]<br><br>
<a href= "pic13.html">水资源分布（Water Resource）</a><br><br>


In addition to the supply-augmentation approach represented by the SNWTP, the Chinese government has also attempted to improve water use efficiency and to limit overall demand. A 2002 Water Law attempted to establish a strict licensing regime whereby virtually all water resources were declared to be the property of the state, and water use was made contingent on obtaining a usage license from local authorities. At the same time, the Water Conservancy Commissions (WCCs; Shuili weiyuanhui 水利委员会) established under the Ministry of Water Resources (MWR; Shuilibu 水利部) in China’s major river basins were given comprehensive water use planning responsibilities which were intended to guide local water use licensing.[13] Subsequent regulations[14] have established the basis for water rights trading, and a few such transfers have taken place between municipalities.[15] <br><br>

In 2010, China’s Communist Party Central Committee and State Council promulgated a “three red lines” (santiao hongxian 三条红线) policy intended to establish clear and binding limits on water quantity usage, efficiency, and quality. In early 2012, the State Council announced that the “three red lines” policy would limit total national water consumption to less than 700 billion cubic meters per year, amounting to approximately three-quarters of China’s total annual exploitable freshwater resources.[16] In addition, the policy attempts to increase irrigation use efficiency to 60% by 2030.[17] These headline policies are augmented by increased investment, including 1.8 trillion RMB in 2011-2015, primarily for irrigation infrastructure improvements, rural clean water delivery, and reservoir enhancements.[18] <br><br>

In combination, these policies seek to redress China’s regional imbalance in water availability, while making overall water use sustainable. However, they are likely to be undermined by conflict between regions which are asked to bear the costs of storing and transferring water, and those which benefit as a result. The dynamics of these conflicts is illustrated by the case of a dam, first proposed in 1954, intended to be built on the upper reaches of the Yellow River in order to provide water to poor farmers in Ningxia. Gansu Province, claiming that the dam would inundate some of its best farmland, has managed to prevent construction of the dam by lobbying different elements of the central government than those which had supported the dam. The dispute remains unresolved; in 2010, Ningxia’s representatives to the China People’s Political Consultative Conference (zhengzhi xie shanghuiyi 政治协商会议) took the unusual step of presenting a petition to the full Conference to build the dam.[19] <br><br>

Similarly, water-exporting provinces in central China have complained at the costs they are expected to bear as part of the SNWTP for water treatment, refugee resettlement, and other issues, prompting the central government to impose an “SNWTP tax” on Beijing and other beneficiaries of the project.[20] Similar rivalries threaten to undermine water licensing and water rights trading schemes. In times of shortage, upstream provinces often reduce flows to their downstream neighbors,[21] and regularly appropriate water in excess of MWR quotas.[22] In short, although China’s current policies can theoretically alleviate the geographic imbalance in water resources, they do not adequately address the inter-jurisdictional political and economic conflicts which are likely to result. In a similar fashion, policies to improve water quality are undermined by the complexity of relationships between central and local levels of government. <br><br>

A crisis of water quality <br><br>

Water quality is arguably an even more serious problem than is water shortage. In rural areas, where less than half the population has access to purified water, agricultural run-off is the dominant pollution source, while in urban areas human and industrial waste are left largely untreated, contaminating both surface and underground water supplies.[23] Recent reports from China’s environmental protection authorities indicate that in the country as a whole, less than half of China’s water can be treated to the point where it is safe for drinking, and a quarter of surface waters are so polluted that they are unfit even for industrial use. Independent estimates are even more pessimistic.[24] <br><br>

This crisis of water quality has contributed to a serious environmental health crisis. Arsenic poisoning from contaminated groundwater is thought to be widespread, and in some areas high incidences of particular cancers have been linked to organic water pollution.[25] The ecological impact of high pollution levels is also acute, dramatically reducing freshwater wild fish populations as well as driving larger animals like the baiji (白D豚), or Yangtze dolphin, to the very brink of extinction.[26] Water pollution issues have, moreover, proved to be particularly politically contentious. In 2005, the accidental release of some 100 tons of carcinogenic chemicals into a river near China’s northeastern border with Russia produced a diplomatic crisis,[27] and in 2001 pollution from dye factories in Suzhou provoked residents of downstream Jiaxing, Zhejiang Province to pool funds to buy old boats and sink them in the waterway, forming a dam that blocked up the polluted water into neighboring Jiangsu Province.[28]<br><br>

The Chinese government’s policy responses to water quality issues rely largely on strengthening monitoring capabilities and enforcement mechanisms. The 2008 Water Pollution Law attempted to strengthen earlier legislation by providing for increased penalties, including stiff fines for the executives of polluting enterprises.[29] As part of a broader push to expand monitoring of pollution, Regional Supervision Centers were established throughout China to keep an eye on local enterprises,[30] and water quality bureaus were set up within the MWR’s river basin commissions. This institutional expansion has been complemented by continuing regulatory reform. The “three red lines” policy introduced a new requirement that 95% of tested water must meet national water quality guidelines, which have recently been expanded and updated to cover a wide range of organic and microbial pollutants as well as concentrations of heavy metals.[31] To help meet these standards, the government announced in late 2011 a five-year, 380 billion RMB investment plan to improve urban wastewater treatment facilities, as well as the establishment of some 14,000 monitoring stations throughout the country to continuously monitor water quality.[32] <br><br>

Just as regional rivalries threaten to undermine water quantity policies, however, bureaucratic fragmentation and capacity discrepancies threaten to de-rail these water quality initiatives. Although MWR is broadly responsible for water project construction and water quantity issues, the Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP; Huanjing baohu bu 环境保护部) is primarily responsible for water pollution control. MEP is a relatively new entity, having been elevated to ministerial-level status only in 2008, and it is generally less powerful than the older and more established MWR. MEP also lacks institutional capacity relative to MWR; while MEP must supervise hundreds of thousands of enterprises with a core staff numbering in the hundreds, the MWR’s Yellow River Conservancy Commission alone employs some 30,000 people.[33] This imbalance in resources means that MEP relies on local environmental protection bureaus (EPBs), over which it possesses only partial control, to enforce water pollution regulations. <br><br>

Such incomplete control is a consequence of China’s distinctive tiao-kuai (条块) administrative system, in which officials at lower levels of government are responsible both to line control by functional bureaucracies, such as the various ministries, as well as to territorial government leaders, including mayors and provincial governors.[34] These territorial government cadres are evaluated and promoted based on a detailed set of criteria known as kaohe (考核) which prioritizes economic growth, with the result that they often pressure EPBs to employ “light-touch” regulation, or encourage enterprises to channel pollution into waterways which flow into neighboring jurisdictions.  MEP’s difficulty in exercising control over EPBs also stems from China’s decentralized fiscal structure, in which environmental protection authorities are financed largely by pollution fines levied in their individual jurisdictions rather than centrally-disbursed grants. [35] <br><br>

MEP’s difficulties in exercising sufficient supervision and enforcement of local EPBs are illustrated by a recent chemical pollution incident in Yancheng, Jiangsu Province.[36] In 2004, environmental protection authorities raised concerns regarding water pollution in the city, and in 2005 the Biaoxin Chemical Company was fined for exceeding pollution discharge limitations and ordered to eliminate discharges into waterways within Yancheng. In 2008, local environmental protection authorities decreed that all industrial enterprises were to be re-located away from the city’s river, its primary source of drinking water. These directives were ignored, however, and in 2009 Biaoxin Chemical released large quantities of carbolic acid into the waterway, forcing some 200,000 people to rely on bottled water and wells for several days. MEP called a press conference pledging to punish those responsible, and a subsequent investigation concluded that company officials concluded simply that regulatory “compliance is expensive, evasion is cheap” (shoufa chengben gao, weifa chengben di守法成本高，违法成本低). As a result of the investigation, two local environmental protection officials were fired for neglecting their duties, and another five were reprimanded.[37] Nonetheless, similar if less dramatic releases of highly toxic pollutants remain common, reflecting the institutional barriers to resolving China’s water quality crisis.<br><br>

Management of the Yellow River: a partial success story<br><br>

China’s water quantity and quality problems coincide dramatically in the case of the Yellow River, where management efforts in recent decades have partially succeeded in easing chronic over-use of water resources while nonetheless leaving fundamental issues unaddressed. The Yellow is one of the world’s most intensively exploited river systems, being home to some 110 million people in the semi-arid North China Plain. Since the early 1970s, the scale of water withdrawal from the river has meant that it has failed to reach the sea for much of the year, a phenomenon known in Chinese as “desiccation of the Yellow” or Huangehe duanliu (黄河断流). In the early 1980s, the MWR’s Yellow River Conservancy Commission (YRCC; Huanghe shuili weiyuanhui 黄河水利委员会) formulated a provincial water resource allocation plan which granted the more economically-developed provinces of the middle and lower reaches the right to utilize much of the river’s flow. [38]  <br><br>However, rapid population growth and economic development along the upper reaches outstripped estimates, and in 1995-1998, the Yellow failed to reach the sea for about 120 days each year, in some years failing even to reach Shandong Province.[39] Consequently, in 1998 the YRCC promulgated more strict provincial water use regulations[40] and began planning a sophisticated “Digital Yellow River” (shuzi Huangehe 数字黄河)system to monitor water use and flow conditions in near-real time.[41]<br><br>

These efforts have been successful in halting the desiccation of the Yellow, which has continually reached the sea since 1999. However, flows remain below levels considered necessary to satisfy ecological needs, and water quality has continued to deteriorate, with the percentage of river water designated as “Class V” or lowest-quality water increasing from 34 to 42% from 1998-2001.[42] Much of these lingering problems stem from the inter-jurisdictional conflict and mismatched incentives described above. Referring to the 1998 regulations, a 2011 YRCC report acknowledged that “In implementing the Yellow River water quantity regulations, there exist some localities which do not put into practice the water quantity allocation and dispatch plan, and exceed the allocation limits in using water resulting from inter-provincial flows not according with control limits.”[43] A recent Caijing news report likewise notes that provinces skirt Yellow River allocation rules by extracting water from tributaries of the Yellow before it enters the main stream. “Tributary water quantity allocations are not clearly defined,” the report notes, “meaning that each province can utilize water before it enters the Yellow River, and before it becomes part of the Yellow River water quantity allocation limits.”[44] The case of the Yellow River thus illustrates that while China has the capacity to address some of its pressing water resource challenges, fully meeting them will require deeper and more systematic reform of governance systems and institutions.   <br><br>      

Water Scarcity and Pollution: Constraints on China’s future?<br><br>

China’s water resource challenges are acute, but it has also developed a substantial policy infrastructure to meet them. What remains is to ensure that policies to address water scarcity and to improve water quality are implemented effectively and efficiently. The barriers to policy implementation identified in this Issue Brief reflect some deep-seated and systematic issues in China’s governance system. Inter-jurisdictional and inter-agency coordination, cooperation, and communication mechanisms are under-developed, while weaknesses in the rule of law undermine regulation and enforcement procedures. Fully addressing water quantity and quality issues therefore entails some basic and systematic institutional and political reforms, all of which will require substantial political will. Nonetheless, if this can be mustered, five reforms would greatly aid China in addressing water resource quantity and quality issues. <br><br>
First, the Party’s cadre evaluation system should be overhauled to emphasize environmental and water resource management metrics. Some reforms have already been undertaken, but economic and stability criteria remain of paramount importance. [45] Although environmental outcomes are more difficult to measure than GDP growth, technologies like those employed in the Digital Yellow River system make it easier to hold cadres responsible for water quality and quantity issues within their jurisdictions. <br><br>
Second, formalized mechanisms for inter-provincial consultation should be established at regional scales. In particular, provincial governments should be given formal representation on the Water Conservancy Commissions which manage China’s major river basins on behalf of MWR. Although the Commissions maintain extensive links with local governments, formalizing representation would improve stakeholder involvement and enhance policy buy-in. <br><br>
Third, high-level encouragement should be given to inter-governmental cooperation on water resource issues, which are by nature inter-departmental. As part of this initiative, a high-level working group should be established under the State Council to coordinate policy implementation between MWR, MEP, and other relevant entities, and provide advice to decision-makers. This effort should be led by a senior leader, preferably at the Presidential or Prime Ministerial level, in order to ensure active participation by ministerial units. <br><br>
Fourth, the central government should aim to strengthen the legal system to enable more effective water rights trading. Title and trading procedures should be clarified, special courts for dispute resolution created, and markets brought to a larger scale. Ideally this effort should be undertaken as part of a broader set of legal reforms which might aim to strengthen judicial independence and the rule of law more generally.    <br><br>
Fifth, both MEP and MWR should encourage the involvement of civil society groups in water pollution monitoring. Although the government is wary of such involvement, it can channel growing concern over water issues for constructive purposes by making civil society groups an adjunct to water pollution monitoring efforts.  <br><br>

The gravity of China’s water resource challenges cannot be overstated―in order to chart a sustainable development pathway in future decades China must use substantially less water much more efficiently, while also improving water quality. The government has built the foundations of a credible policy response, but these must be strengthened, expanded and built upon if China is to avoid a water resource constraint to its future growth and development.<br><br>

Population, Policy, and Politics: How Will History Judge China’s One-Child Policy?<br><br>

One of the main puzzles of modern population and social history is why,
among all countries confronting rapid population growth in the second half
of the twentieth century, China chose to adopt an extreme measure of birth
control known as the one-child policy. A related question is why such a policy,
acknowledged to have many undesirable consequences, has been retained for
so long, even beyond the period of time anticipated by its creators.<br><br>
With the world’s population growth rate now at half its historical peak
level and with nearly half of the world’s population living in countries with
fertility below replacement level, we can look back at the role politics played
in formulating, implementing, and reformulating policies aimed at slowing
population growth (Demeny and McNicoll 2006; Robinson and Ross 2007;
Demeny 2011). In this context, an examination of China’s unprecedented
government intervention in reproduction offers valuable lessons in appreciating
the role of politics in the global effort of birth control in the twentieth
century.<br><br>
Aside from the rise and fall of Communism, family planning programs
along with the Green Revolution could be considered two of the most consequential
social experiments of the twentieth century. These two experiments
differ, however, in both content and approach. The Green Revolution
was aimed at feeding the population, while family planning programs were
designed to curtail its growth. The Green Revolution was technological, economic,
and global, while family planning programs were social, political, and
often country specific.<br><br>
Nowhere in the world did politics and policies figure more prominently
in the effort to control population growth than in China. The policy of allowing all couples to have only one child finds no equal in the world and it
may be one of the most draconian examples of government social engineering
ever seen. In this essay, we cast China’s one-child policy in the changing
global context of population policymaking, we revisit the supposed necessity
of such a policy by examining the claim that the policy was responsible for
preventing 400 million births, and we discuss the reasons such a policy, with
all its known negative consequences, has been allowed to stay in place for
more than thirty years since its inception.<br><br>
Entry: Population and politics<br><br>
The world in the second half of the twentieth century saw the fastest rate
of population growth ever in human history. While the main driver of this
growth, the unprecedented lengthening of human life expectancy, had its
seeds in the previous centuries, the momentum of population growth by the
early twentieth century was spreading from industrialized countries in Europe
and North America to the rest of the world, especially Asia and Latin America,
where the majority of the world’s population resided (Reher 2011).<br><br>
Rapid population growth created challenges in many societies and led
to a global movement of birth control, soon with the active involvement
of national governments. This movement can be dated to the early 1950s,
shortly after the end of World War II, with events such as adoption of the first
national population policy in India, the establishment of the International
Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF), and the founding of the Population
Council with the support of the Rockefeller Foundation (Sinding 2007). <br><br>
Two views of birth control programs emerged: the earlier one focusing on
providing contraceptives for voluntary use without joining forces with governments
in order to avoid interfering with individual reproduction choice;
the later one legitimating and promoting the role of government in restricting
individual reproductive freedom for the sake of controlling population
growth (ibid.).<br><br>
By the mid-1960s, the population control movement had gained new
allies, with more and more international organizations identifying population
growth as a hindrance to economic growth and a potential risk to political
stability in the world’s less developed areas. Funding increased from both
governments of the developed world and private foundations. The United
Nations established its Fund for Population Activities (now the UN Population
Fund) in 1969. The first UN-organized World Population Conference was held
in 1974 in Bucharest.1 Although the conference ended in some controversy,
it represented a “great step toward better national solutions and ultimately
toward a better world” (Demeny 1984, p. 359).<br><br>
China was an example of the contradiction between rhetoric and action
evident in Bucharest. At the conference, the Chinese delegation denounced the call for population control from the West as part of an imperialist agenda
and claimed that population is not a determinant of national economic
growth and well-being (Demeny 1985). At home, however, a nationwide
birth control program was already well underway. Ten years before the Bucharest
conference, China had established the Birth Planning Commission
within the State Council to lead its birth control efforts, with a long-term goal
of reducing the population growth rate to 1 percent by 2000 (Yang, Liang,
and Zhang 2001, p. 34). (The growth rate in 1962 was 2.7 percent.) In talking
with the American journalist Edgar Snow in the mid-1960s and later, Mao
Zedong complained that few rural women were practicing contraception.<br><br>
In 1971, a Chinese State Council document made reducing the population
growth rate to 1 percent in cities and 1.5 percent in rural areas by 1975 part
of China’s fourth Five-Year Plan. By the time of the Bucharest conference,
fertility in urban China, at 1.98, was already below replacement. A year after
the conference, another goal was set to reduce the rural population growth
rate to 1 percent and the urban rate to 0.6 percent (Liang 2007, p. 116). The
national growth rate in 1975 was 1.57 percent.<br><br>
China was not the only country where rhetoric did not match reality.<br><br>
Eight years before the Bucharest conference, India’s Ministry of Public Health
had been renamed the Ministry of Public Health and Family Planning, and a
special department on family planning was formed within the ministry. Two
years after the conference, at which an Indian delegate famously argued that
“development is the best contraceptive,” a National Population Policy statement
proclaimed that sharply reducing fertility was a “top national priority
and commitment.” India’s notorious forced sterilization campaign was carried
out between 1975 and 1976, during which more than 8 million sterilizations
were performed (Harkavy and Roy 2007; Visaria 2002). The campaign led
to the collapse of Indira Gandhi’s government in January 1977 and resulted
in new approaches to birth control. In 1977, family planning in India was
renamed family welfare, and sterilization targets were sharply reduced. By
the mid-1990s, all targets related to birth control had been removed (Harkavy
and Roy 2007).<br><br>
In a number of other countries with large populations and rapid growth
rates, such as Bangladesh and Indonesia, coercive methods of a lesser degree
were also used (Sinding 2007, p. 8). All around the world, governments in
countries experiencing rapid population growth recognized the challenges
they faced and considered the level of fertility in their country too high. Between
1976 and 1996, the number of governments viewing their population
growth rate as too high increased from 55 to 87 (UN 2010).<br><br>
By launching a nationwide policy of limiting each couple to only one
child, China, of course, established an unprecedented level of government
control of births. What forces and political contexts led China to adopt the
one-child policy? Moreover, why did opposition to intrusive measures of birth control lead to a quick reversal in policy in India, while in China the onechild
policy continues to the present? Three features of the Chinese political
system and associated policymaking help explain the Chinese exception: a
statist tradition and bureaucratic institutions that treat individual citizens as
subjects of the state; a post-revolutionary regime that places birth control at
the heart of its political legitimacy; and a policymaking process that is carried
out among political elites shrouded with secrecy and lacking public scrutiny.<br><br>
Combined, these three features of the Chinese political system help explain
not only the design but also the survival of the one-child policy.<br><br>
The one-child policy was launched at a time when China’s political leadership
was reestablishing its political legitimacy following the death of Mao
Zedong in 1976. In contrast to Mao and his generation of leaders, who based
their political legitimacy on armed revolutions that led to the founding of the
People’s Republic, the post-Mao leadership could no longer count on such a
legacy. The devastating aftermath of the Cultural Revolution at the time of
Mao’s death presented the greatest crisis for the Chinese Communist Party
(CCP) in its nearly three-decade rule. The post-Mao leadership consequently
made economic development the new mandate and the fundamental basis
of its political legitimacy. The measure used to gauge its success in increasing
living standards of the population was per capita GDP growth. With this new
mandate and focus, controlling population growth became a critical component
of this legitimacy. In 1982, birth control was announced as a “basic state
policy” (jiben guoce).2<br><br>
Historical studies of the design of the one-child policy reveal a fluid,
complex, and at times confused process involving many actors. The core calculation
leading to the policy began soon after Mao’s death (Sun 1987; White
2006; Greenhalgh and Winckler 2005; Scharping 2003; Liang 2007, 2010;
Greenhalgh 2008). As part of the modernization drive, a goal was proposed in
September 1977, of reducing China’s annual population growth rate to below
1 percent within three years. The goal, formally stated in the government’s
Working Report in February 1978 (Yang, Liang, and Zhang 2001, p. 62), was
not achieved until 1998. The planning mentality, treating population simply
as a number that can be planned and regulated, was clearly evident.<br><br>
The idea of one-child families, as a means to achieving the goal of reducing
the birth rate quickly, came from political leaders as early as 1978,
two years before the policy was announced nationally. In June 1978, the
policy measure of “encouraging couples to have one child, at most two” was
formally stated in a CCP Central Committee document, to be followed by
concrete measures adopted in over ten provinces in the same year. These
measures included rewarding parents having only one child and punishing
those with two or more (Liang 2007, 119).3 By January 1979, official Chinese
news outlets, the People’s Daily and Xinhua News Agency, reported and printed
editorials that clearly called for one child per couple, with “at most two.”<br><br>

They also reconfirmed the measures already proposed in some provinces,
namely to reward couples pledging to have only one child and to punish those
with two or more. In June 1979, the headline in the People’s Daily report of a
speech by Chen Muhua, then head of the National Family Planning Leading
Group, read: “To move the focus of birth control work to having one child is
the best approach.” The leaders who lent the strongest support to this goal,
not surprisingly, were those in charge of economic planning.4<br><br>
A coherent set of demographic goals emerged by February 1980 in
support of the economic developmental goals advanced by the Chinese leadership.
These goals included a total population of 1.2 billion by 2000 and a
population growth rate of zero, supported by concrete measures of restricting
95 percent of urban couples and 90 percent of rural couples to having
only one child. The 1.2 billion population size figure, while still unclear how
calculated, clearly conformed to the overall goal set by Deng Xiaoping of
quadrupling China’s per capita income between 1980 and 2000, to $1,000.<br><br>
Given that a per capita income goal was already set and the growth of the
total economy (the numerator for calculating the per capita GDP) could be
projected at a certain rate, determining the denominator, namely the total
population, should not be difficult.<br><br>
A strategy of GDP growth has remained the chief goal at all levels of
the Chinese political system, and population has been made a lifeless number,
not an aggregation of individual lives, in this pursuit. Such a pursuit is
further reinforced by the CCP’s cadre performance evaluation system that
measures government officials’ performance with numeric indexes, such as
GDP per capita or government revenue per capita.5 This per capita metric,
using population size simply as part of the political calculation for achieving
political goals, has been a constant driving force to justify the continuation
of the one-child policy.<br><br>
With an overall political goal set and with population size entered into
the calculation of achieving that goal, the policymaking process led directly to
the promulgation and continued existence of the one-child policy. Here, an
extremely important policy justified by the goal of maintaining Communist
Party legitimacy was left in the hands of elite political leaders, whose decisions
few could challenge. Dissent and reservations notwithstanding, Party elders
were instrumental in implementing the policy. <br><br>Seizing on these signals for an
even stricter birth control policy than those implemented by other governments
in the 1970s, Chinese scholars, especially those with updated knowledge
and skills in the natural sciences, offered more definitive calculations and
population projections under different fertility scenarios, and pushed for the
formalization of the one-child policy (Greenhalgh 2008). Both the temporal
sequence of policy formulation and the prevailing style of decisionmaking of
the CCP, however, suggest clearly that the idea of the one-child policy came
from leaders within the Party, not from scientists who offered evidence to support it (Liang 2007).6 But the work of the scientists nevertheless provided
what the leaders wanted: population numbers that suggested a doomed future
for China if extreme measures were not taken. Moreover, these scientists
provided fertility numbers to achieve the goal the planners wished, under a
cloak of scientism that evinced authority, confidence, and elegance (Greenhalgh
2008). The fears of neo-Malthusian crisis increased, fanned not only
by the scientists but also by academia and the state-controlled media (Lee
and Wang 1999).<br><br>
The one-child policy strangely was never issued as a government order
nor written explicitly in Chinese law, but rather was announced in the form
of an Open Letter to members of the Chinese Communist Party and the
Communist Youth League, in the language of “advocating” such a policy.<br><br>
Worries about the consequence of the one-child policy, such as population
aging and lack of old-age support, sex imbalance, and future labor shortages,
were acknowledged in the Open Letter. Demographers argued that there
were alternative ways of reaching the population target of 1.2 billion by
2000 (Liang 1983; Bongaarts and Greenhalgh 1985). Facing resistance both
within and outside the CCP, China’s legislative body, the National People’s
Congress, resisted suggestions for enacting a national law requiring one child
per couple.7 The Open Letter contained both recognition of the sacrifices that
Chinese families would have to endure and a promise to change the policy in
25C30 years. As for the difficult task of enforcing the policy, it was left to each
province to translate the policy into concrete requirements and to specify the
exemptions allowed (Gu et al. 2007).<br><br>
Legacies: What contributions has
the one-child policy made?<br><br>
At the time the one-child policy was announced to the Chinese public, the
designers of the policy anticipated a faster pace of population aging as a result
and acknowledged the policy’s deleterious effect on the kinship structure of
Chinese families. Over the course of the policy, unanticipated consequences
also emerged, such as physical, often violent abuses, sex-selective abortion,
and, more recently, a risk of a depressed fertility level that could lead to irreversible
population aging, labor shortage, and economic slowdown and
stagnation (Wang 2011). For its critics, the one-child policy is a blunt violation
of basic human rights and an intrusion into individuals’ and families’
reproductive freedom.<br><br>
Supporters and sympathizers, even some of the critics, however, have
accepted the policy in the belief that it has played a positive role in containing
global population growth and in saving the world from unbearable population
pressure. A common claim is that the policy has prevented some 400
million Chinese births. This claim originated with the Chinese government, which credits the policy for undergirding China’s economic miracle. In the
Party’s view, the fertility reduction helped create a population age structure
favorable for economic growth. The government has even suggested that
its population control effort was a major contribution to the global effort to
address the negative consequences of climate change. No one, however, has
seriously examined the validity of this claim.<br><br>
Where did the claim of 400 million births prevented come from, and
how credible is it? The original calculation of the number of the births prevented
came from a project sponsored by China’s National Population and
Family Planning Commission, completed in the late 1990s, with a goal to
evaluate the inputs and the benefits of China’s birth control program (Yang,
Chen, and Wei 2000). The authors used a simplistic extrapolation method,
projecting what the crude birth rate would have been by 1998 had China’s
birth rate followed the trajectory of decline between 1950 and 1970. Their
projected crude birth rate for China was 29.7 per thousand by 1990 and 28.4
per thousand by 1998. Given that the observed birth rate after 1970 fell far
below these rates, the authors calculated the number of births attributed to
the difference between the predicted and the observed birth rates as the number
of births “averted.” For the period 1970 to 1998, the number derived was
338 million. In the decade after the publication of this number, the number
of births averted was raised to 400 million.<br><br>
In stating that the one-child policy averted 400 million births, the promoters
of the policy first misinterpreted the original results from the study
mentioned above. The number of births averted was for the period since 1970,
not from 1980, when the one-child policy was formally implemented nationwide.<br><br>
This mistake is crucial because most of China’s fertility transition was
completed during the decade of the 1970s―that is, before China’s one-child
policy was enacted. Within that decade, China’s total fertility rate dropped by
more than half, from 5.8 in 1970 to 2.8 in 1979. Most of the births averted, if
any, were due to the rapid fertility decline of that decade, not to the one-child
policy that came afterward.<br><br>
Even the number of 338 million births averted appears to be a result
of over-generous assumptions, not reality. To examine what China’s birth
rate or fertility would have been in the absence of the one-child policy, we
use data from countries that had a birth rate similar to China’s in 1970 to
compare the trajectory of change in these countries with that of China. There
were 16 countries in 1970 with a population of at least one million that had
a birth rate between 30 and 38 per thousand, 12 of which had a level that
was higher than China’s at the time, 33.4 per thousand (Table 1). The average
of these 16 countries was 35.6 per thousand. The average birth rate in this
group of countries declined to 26.6 per thousand by 1990 and 22.0 by 1998,
both significantly below the levels predicted by the authors who arrived at
the “births averted” numbers. This comparison shows that in other countries without a one-child policy the birth rate also declined, and it declined below
the level predicted for China.<br><br>
To further examine the claim that China’s one-child policy was necessary
to lower fertility, we also explore a counterfactual: what would China’s
fertility be if there were no one-child policy? We use the Bayesian model developed
by Alkema et al. (2011), the same used for the latest United Nations
population projections (United Nations 2011). The Bayesian model projects
China’s future fertility scenarios based on: 1) the fertility trend in China before
launching the one-child policy and 2) fertility trends in all other countries.<br><br>
Fertility in China would have continued to decline if the country’s rapid
fertility decline in the 1970s offers any hint about the country’s future fertility
trajectory. According to the Bayesian model, the decline would have continued
after 1980. By 2010, fertility would have fallen to its currently observed
level of around 1.5 children per woman.<br><br>
Moreover, the counterfactual scenario shows that the fertility level
observed for the early 1980s was somewhat higher than what would be
expected from the empirical Bayesian model. This seems to be counterintuitive, but it might be explained by the anxiety caused by policy uncertainty,
which prompted many couples to have children earlier than they would have
otherwise. This tempo effect is shown in the declines in ages at first marriage
and first childbearing in the 1980s. In addition, the policy overemphasized
meeting short-term (period) targets (e.g., reducing the population growth rate
to 5 per thousand by 1985) and overlooked the tempo and cohort effects in
reducing population momentum. Calculations of a universal two-child policy
with spacing, as advocated by Liang Zhongtang, have demonstrated that such
an approach would not only have achieved China’s population control goal,
but would also have produced more favorable social and demographic conditions
(Gu and Wang 2009). If we apply the same empirical Bayesian model to
contemporary China, lifting the one-child policy is unlikely to have a major
impact on population size. Experience from other countries shows that raising
fertility is probably an even more challenging task than reducing it (Frejka,
Jones, and Sardon 2010; Goldstein, Sobotka, and Jasilioniene 2009).<br><br>
If the one-child policy did not achieve its goal of preventing hundreds of
millions of births in China, the question then becomes why is it widely criticized
as a cause for many of China’s short- and long-term social problems,
and why have so many both in China and abroad urged that it be phased out.<br><br>
The one-child policy is criticized not just because of the demographic uncertainty
it has caused. More fundamentally, it is seen as an ill-conceived policy
that has prevented Chinese individuals and families from having the number
of children they desire. It is a policy that has forcefully altered family and kinship
for many Chinese, has contributed to an unbalanced sex ratio at birth,
and has produced effects that will be felt for generations, with its burden
falling disproportionately on those many couples who were forced to have
only one child. In other words, at the same time as the demographic effect of
the one-child policy in controlling population growth has been exaggerated,
its long-term impact on Chinese society has been underappreciated.<br><br>
A particularly long-lasting consequence is the hundreds of millions of
families with only one child. Although, with declining fertility, some families
would opt for one child voluntarily even if the government had not imposed
the draconian restriction, there is little reason to believe that the proportion
of families with only one child in China would ever have reached the level
we currently observe. To quantify the social effect of the one-child policy, we
estimate the proportion of Chinese families with only one child. We restrict
our calculation to women aged 35 to 44 in 2005. We focus on this group for
two reasons: first, these women spent their prime reproductive years under
the one-child policy; second, by age 35 and over, they have mostly completed
their childbearing.8<br><br>
Among this group of women, numbering just over 110 million, who
were born between 1961 and 1970 and by now are all aged over 40, a large
proportion will complete their childbearing with no more than one child. In 2005, nationally, over 40 percent of them had only one child. The proportion
of one-child women varies widely by province, from a high of nearly 80
percent in the urban centers of Shanghai and Beijing, to a low of less than
20 percent in the western provinces of Guizhou, Yunnan, and Tibet. In 11
of China’s 31 mainland provincial-level administrative regions, over half of
women aged 35C44 had only one child. If we treat each married woman as
representing a single-couple family, then roughly 50 million families in this
age group will have only one child.<br><br>
The share of families with only one child is even more pronounced in
China’s cities, where the one-child policy is most strictly enforced (Gu et al.
2007). Couples with non-agricultural household registration status (hukou)
not only face a stiff fine for violating the one-child rule, but also risk losing
employment and being unable to register their children for health care and
education. Among women in our sample, roughly 18 percent have nonagricultural
household status. Among these urban families, the proportion of
one-child families is 86 percent. In ten Chinese provincial regions, this share
exceeds 90 percent, and in the three provincial-level urban centers, Beijing,
Shanghai, and Tianjin, and in Liaoning province, the share is over 95 percent.<br><br>
Among urban Chinese families of the 1960s birth cohort, who will begin to
reach age 60 in less than a decade from now, a virtually universal one-child
family world is already a reality.<br><br>
In contrast to the demographic effects of the one-child policy in reducing
population growth, which can at best be very small, the policy’s social
effect in depriving a large proportion of Chinese families of a second child is
enormous. A simple calculation illustrates the magnitude of this impact: allowing
15 million families in this age group to have a second child results in
1.5 million more births per year over a ten-year period and could virtually
eliminate all one-child families in this age group of urban families.9 Applying
the figure of 15 million to the whole country, the share of one-child families
nationwide in this age group would drop from 42 percent to 28 percent. The
figure of 15 million is trivial in comparison to the total number of births over
a ten-year period in China. Assuming most of the women aged 35C44 in 2005
had their children during the years 1985 to 2000, and given that the annual
average number of births for this period was about 22 million, the additional
1.5 million births amounts to only 6.8 percent more births, a number that is
inconsequential for total births for each year or for population growth, but
extremely consequential for a large number of Chinese families.<br><br>
The policy’s long-lasting social consequences will be judged by the future
lives of China’s one-child generation and their parents. China today has about
150 million families with only one child, accounting for more than a third of
all families.10 Among the post-one-child generation of parents, the share is
even higher. This is the population structure with which China will have to
confront the challenge of rapid population aging at the societal level. <br><br>

Exit: People vs. population<br><br>
In less than half a century, the alarm that unprecedented population growth
caused in many counties in the mid and late twentieth century has turned to
concerns over population decline and aging. Moreover, the twentieth century
saw not only population growth but also extraordinary growth in material
wealth (Lam 2011). While, in parts of the world, especially sub-Saharan Africa,
rapid population growth still poses serious challenges to poverty reduction
and economic prosperity, more and more countries are now concerned with
sustained low fertility and its consequences. The number of countries where
the government considered its fertility level too low had increased from 16 in
1976 to 47 in 2006. Among 48 countries with a total fertility rate below 1.8
children per woman in 2009, over 70 percent considered their fertility too low
(United Nations 2010). Countries in Europe and Asia have begun incentive
programs to encourage couples to have more children (Demeny 2003; Frejka,
Jones, and Sardon 2010; Demeny 2011). The latest entry is Iran, where total
fertility dropped from 4.8 in 1990 to 1.9 in 2006 (Roudi 2012).<br><br>
China today is also economically, demographically, and socially vastly
different from 35 years ago, when the one-child policy was officially initiated.<br><br>
The goal of quadrupling per capita income from $250 to $1,000 by the
year 2000, seemingly wildly ambitious when first set by Deng Xiaoping in
1980, was achieved in roughly half the time. Today, with per capita GDP at
over $8,000, China has joined the ranks of the high-middle-income countries.
China’s economy is second only to the United States in total size, and
the question for the future is not whether but when China will become the
world’s largest economy. While China’s economic growth exceeded the goal
set at the start of the post-Mao era by a wide margin, the goal of not permitting
the population to exceed 1.2 billion was not achieved, even with the
draconian one-child policy. China’s 2000 census reported a total population
of 1.26 billion. However, in light of the much faster economic growth, the
extra 60 million should be of little concern.<br><br>
Even with the better-than-expected economic growth, however, Chinese
policymakers have not revised their original population goals to allow
couples to have more children. Unlike other governments around the world,
under which declines in fertility level have led to revisions and reversals of
their population policy, in China the process of policy review and revision
has been surprisingly long and slow. Almost 35 years after it was ushered in
as an emergency response to population growth, the one-child policy, with
its many known deleterious consequences, is still in place.<br><br>
Why has China been so slow in phasing out a policy that has become
increasingly unpopular among the public―a policy that was initially defended
by deeply flawed science? This policy was only able to survive because of
those three features of the Chinese political system and policymaking process that we outlined earlier. Moreover, the huge birth planning apparatus that
was created in the process of implementing the one-child policy has become
a main force of resistance to policy change. Not only does it produce and disseminate
misinformation such as that the one-child policy has averted 400
million births, but it continues the practices of coercion and other heavyhanded
tactics.<br><br>
The question, however, is not whether, but when, the one-child policy
will be phased out. Politically, the Chinese leadership has come to realize
that the country can no longer continue the old development model that
sacrifices long-term benefits for short-term gains, that ignores individual
rights and welfare, and that elevates economic development above everything
else. Socially, China’s younger generations, especially those born under
the one-child policy in the 1980s and 1990s, have become the most critical
segment of the population not only economically but also socially and politically.<br><br>
These generations are the best educated in Chinese history, are highly
mobile geographically, and exert their power and voice in the sphere of social
media. China’s single-child generations are no longer willing acceptors of the
country’s statist orientation. While many of them are voluntarily postponing
marriage and childbearing, and hence form the driving force of today’s
below-replacement fertility, they also increasingly regard it as their right, not
the government’s, to decide whether and when to have children. To them,
population is no longer a number of aggregated subjects, but individual lives
that should be respected and cherished.11<br><br>
The opening up of Chinese society and the revival of population studies
as an academic discipline have also produced an independent force that can
confront government pressure. A decade and more of research by scholars
has shown consistently that fertility remains well below the replacement level
(Retherford et al. 2005; Guo and Chen 2007; Cai 2008; Morgan, Guo, and
Hayford 2009), and has revealed that the one-child policy is not a main driver
of China’s low fertility (Cai 2010; Gu and Wang 2009; Zheng et al. 2009).<br><br>
Leading demographers have formed a collective voice calling for phasing out
the policy (Gu and Li 2010; Zeng 2007). Insistence on maintaining the policy
has become increasingly a political liability.<br><br>
History will remember China’s one-child policy as the most extreme example
of state intervention in human reproduction in the modern era. History
will also likely view this policy as a very costly blunder, born of the legacy of
a political system that planned population numbers in the same way that it
planned the production of goods. It showcases the impact of a policymaking
process that, in the absence of pubic deliberations, transparency, debate, and
accountability, can do permanent harm to the members of a society.<br><br>
The one-child policy will be added to the other deadly errors in recent
Chinese history, including the famine in 1959C61 caused largely by the industrialization
and collectivization campaigns of the late 1950s, and the Cultural Revolution of the late 1960s and early 1970s. While those grave mistakes
both cost tens of millions of lives, the harms done were relatively short-lived
and were corrected quickly afterward. The one-child policy, in contrast, will
surpass them in impact by its role in creating a society with a seriously undermined
family and kin structure, and a whole generation of future elderly
and their children whose well-being will be seriously jeopardized.<br><br>

Get Ready For A Slower China <br><br>

By: Arthur R. Kroeber<br><br>



The recent gyrations in the Chinese interbank market underscore that the chief risk to global growth now comes from China. Make no mistake: credit policy will tighten substantially in the coming months, as the government tries to push loan growth from its current rate of 20% down to something much closer to the rate of nominal GDP growth, which is about half that. Moreover, in the last few months of the year the new government will likely start concrete action on some long-deferred structural reforms. These reforms will bolster China’s medium-term growth prospects, but the short-term impact will be tough for the economy and for markets.<br><br>

The combination of tighter credit and structural reforms means that with the best of luck China could post GDP growth in 2014 of a bit over 6%, its weakest showing in 15 years and well below most current forecasts. A policy mistake such as excessive monetary tightening could easily push growth below the 6% mark. Banks and corporations appear finally to be getting the message that the new government, unlike its predecessor, will not support growth at some arbitrary level through investment stimulus.<br><br>

The dire performance of China’s stock markets in the past two weeks reflects this growing realization among domestic investors, although we suspect stocks have further to fall before weaker growth is fully discounted.<br><br>

Slower growth… but no Armageddon<br><br>

But the China risk is mainly of a negative growth shock, not financial Armageddon as some gloomier commentary suggests. Financial crisis risk remains relatively low because the system is closed and the usual triggers are unavailable. Emerging market financial crises usually erupt for one of two reasons: a sudden departure of foreign creditors or a drying-up of domestic funding sources for banks. China has little net exposure to foreign creditors and runs a large current account surplus, so there is no foreign trigger. And until now, banks have funded themselves mainly from deposits at a loan-to-deposit ratio (LDR) of under 70%, although the increased use of quasi-deposit wealth management products means the true LDR may be a bit higher, especially for smaller banks. The danger arises when banks push up their LDRs and increasingly fund themselves from the wholesale market. So a domestic funding trigger does not exist―yet.<br><br>

The People’s Bank of China clearly understands the systemic risk of letting banks run up lending based on fickle wholesale funding. This is why it put its foot down last week and initially refused to pump money into the straitened interbank market. Interbank and repo rates have dropped back from their elevated levels, but remain significantly above the historical average. The message to banks is clear: lend within your means. This stance raises confidence that Beijing will not let the credit bubble get out of control. But it also raises the odds that both credit and economic growth will slow sharply in the coming 6-12 months.<br><br>

If the economy slows and local stock markets continue to tumble, doesn’t this mean the renminbi will also weaken sharply? Not necessarily. Beijing has a long-term policy interest in increasing the international use of the renminbi, which can only occur if the currency earns a reputation as a reliable store of value in good times and bad. Allowing a sharp devaluation now runs against this interest, and also would be a sharp break from a long-established policy of not resorting to devaluation to stimulate growth, even at moments of severe stress (as in 1997-98 and 2008-09). So while our call on China growth has been marked down, our call on the renminbi has not.<br><br>

Short-term pain is better than long-term stagnation<br><br>

From a broader perspective, the biggest China risk is not that the country suffers a year or two of sharply below-trend growth. If that slowdown reflects more rational credit allocation and the early, painful stages of productivity-enhancing reforms, it will be healthy medicine. And even a much slower China will still be growing faster than all developed markets and most emerging ones.<br><br>

The real risk is rather that the new government will show a lack of nerve or muscle and fail to push through financial sector liberalization, deregulation of markets to favor private firms, and fiscal reforms to curtail local governments’ ability to prop up failing firms, overspend on infrastructure, and inflate property bubbles. The old government wasted the last three years of its term doing none of these things despite the obvious need. The new leaders are talking a better game, but they have a year at most to articulate a clear reform program, begin implementation (liberalizing interest rates and freeing electricity prices would be a good start), and ruthlessly removing senior officials who stand in the way. If they fail to deliver, then the short-term slowdown could become a long and dismal decline.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T7">China’s Increasing Interest in Africa</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
中国在非洲日益增长的利益诉求	<br><br>
Yun Sun   April 5, 2013  <br><br>

China’s Increasing Interest in Africa: Benign 仁慈的；善良的 but Hardly Altruistic无私<br><br>

China’s new leader President Xi Jinping has completed his foreign debut tour as the head of state after visiting Russia and three African countries: Tanzania, South Africa and the Republic of Congo. As the Chinese media hailed his “tremendous victory” and the “successful practice of great power diplomacy with Chinese characteristics”, the issue of China’s role and activities in Africa were once again put under the spotlight. Right before Xi embarked on his trip, Nigerian Central Bank Governor Lamido Sanusi criticized China’s engagement in Africa publicly in the Financial Times. His most quoted charge says “China takes from us primary goods and sells us manufactured ones. This was also the essence of colonialism.”  <br><br>

Sanusi’s comment cast a negative shadow to Xi’s first foreign visit and was met with ferocious rebuttals from an infuriated Beijing. China’s Ministry of Commerce pointed to the western countries’ “exploitation of African resources, trade of African people, occupation of African land and destruction of African culture” as the “essence of colonialism” and argued that it is China, not the West, that has provided support for Africa’s economic and social development.  China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs dispatched the head of its Africa Department, Lu Shaye, to deliver a formal demarche to a Hong Kong media outlet. He defended China’s role in Africa and argued that China has improved Africa’s international status by offering it a powerful alternative market and collaborator, delivering to Africa concrete benefits and treating it as an equal partner. In comparison, he argued, the West only “takes resources from Africa” and treats Africa with a condescending attitude. <br><br>

The drastically diverging perceptions of China’s role in Africa are an interesting phenomenon. The polarization stems from the focus on different aspects of China’s activities on the continent. For example, dragon-slayers emphasize China’s selfish quest for African natural resources and how it sabotages international efforts to keep unpalatable African regimes in check.  On the other hand, panda-huggers applaud China’s contribution to Africa’s economic development through infrastructure projects and revenue creation. <br><br>

Unfortunately, neither reflects the nuanced, mixed nature of what China means to Africa. China enjoys unique financial and political advantages in promoting Africa’s growth through vast financing with little or no strings attached. However, these short-term benefits should not form a cover-up for the potential long-term negative consequences associated with neglecting issues of governance, fairness and sustainability. <br><br>

On the positive side, China’s economic engagement in Africa has created significant benefits for African countries. Most importantly, Beijing has considerable capacity and willingness to provide financing to fuel Africa’s growth. During his recent trip, Xi reconfirmed China’s commitment to provide another $20 billion in financing to Africa. China usually attaches a significant amount of such funding to infrastructure projects, which forms the foundation for Africa’s industrialization and economic development. Many of these projects require large investment and long pay-back terms that traditional donors are reluctant to provide. <br><br>

It is true that China does not emphasize the governance side of the story. This is a reflection of China’s own philosophy on the prioritization between economic development and political progress. Many Chinese officials, analysts and businessmen find the West’s overwhelming emphasis on democracy, governance, transparency in Africa amusing. To the West, they would ask an innocent but critical question: “for people who do not have food on the table, what’s the point of having democracy?” Using its own experience of subjugating political liberalization to the “higher cause” of economic development, China finds its approach to Africa as one that prioritizes the provision of basic elements of development, completely legitimate and fully justified. <br><br>

In this way, China’s intention in Africa is benign. Beijing has no intention to colonize the continent, dictate the politics or economy of the local countries or deprive them of development opportunities. On the contrary, China truly sees itself as Africa’s “brother” and hopes to help African countries develop through infrastructure projects. Beijing seeks an approach different from that of the West, one that avoids the “meddling” with the internal affairs of African countries through conditional aid. In the last several years, China has contributed significantly to the economic growth of some of Africa’s poorest nations. China wants to see a prosperous Africa, which is beneficial to China’s interests as well. <br><br>

However, this does not mean China is being altruistic. Helping Africa is important, but China would not do so if it had nothing to gain.  Indeed, China emphasizes that any bilateral relationship has to be mutually beneficial. And China’s investment in Africa does pay itself back in multiple ways economically: development and exploitation of Africa’s natural resources, access to local market, employment opportunities for Chinese labors and service contracts for Chinese companies on infrastructure projects that China funds. When Chinese officials emphasize that China also invests substantially in countries that are not rich in natural resources to defuse international criticisms, they often forget to mention that China also has its eyes on other things that these countries can deliver, such as their support of Beijing’s “one China” policy, of China’s agenda at multilateral forums and of China as a “responsible stakeholder”.  While there is nothing wrong with not being altruistic in one’s motives, it should be noted that China is not helping Africa in exchange for nothing. <br><br>

In analyzing the nature of China’s activities in Africa, another important voice to examine is that of Africa itself.  Many African countries and officials welcome China’s approach and fiercely defend China internationally. This seems like fairly powerful pushback to western criticisms of China’s role in Africa since African countries should know what they need more than anyone else. Africa’s approval of China poses an intriguing question for those in the West who disapprove of China’s activities in Africa: should the West reexamine its approach to Africa in order to better address what African countries truly need?<br><br>

China in Africa: Implications for U.S. Competition and Diplomacy <br><br>

By: Yun Sun<br><br>

The increasing role of China in Africa may have some negative consequences for the African people with China’s “no strings attached” approach to investment and foreign assistance to the region. Yun Sun outlines areas for increased cooperation between the U.S., China and African countries in order to advance common goals. <br><br>


This chapter is part of Top Five Reasons Why Africa Should Be a Priority for the United States<br><br>
The Priority<br><br>


China is an increasingly important player in the politics, economic development and security of Africa. Historically, China has prioritized strong diplomatic relations and political ties with African states with an ideological aspiration anchored on the “solidarity among the Third World countries.”[1] However, since 2001, China’s pursuit in the continent has rapidly expanded into the economic arena, focusing on Africa’s rich natural resources to fuel China’s domestic economic growth. <br><br>

China’s growing economic presence in Africa is hardly altruistic and is guided by the principle of “mutual benefits” to both sides. Under the framework of “resources for development,” Beijing mobilizes its vast state financial resources to invest broadly in infrastructure projects across Africa and extract natural resources in return. Moreover, these investments generate multiple layers of benefits for China, including contracts for Chinese service companies, the relocation of labor-intensive, heavy-pollution industries from China, political favors extracted from African governments on foreign policy issues at multilateral forums such as the United Nations, and a positive international image of China being a “responsible stakeholder.” These motivations are particularly true in explaining China’s interests in resource-poor African countries. <br><br>

This strategy most likely will continue in the foreseeable future. In July 2012, China doubled its 2009 commitment to provide $20 billion in financing to Africa to further its strategic blueprint in the next three years.[2] The contemporary analysis of China’s role in Africa is dramatically split. Dragon-slayers emphasize China’s selfish quest for Africa’s natural resources and how it sabotages international efforts to keep unpalatable African regimes in check. On the other hand, panda-huggers applaud China’s contribution to Africa’s economic development through infrastructure projects and revenue creation. Neither reflects the nuanced, complicated nature of what China means for Africa. China enjoys unique financial and political advantages in promoting Africa’s growth but neglects the governance, fairness and sustainability of such development. Therefore, the short-term benefit China provides to Africa is intrinsically flawed and has long-term negative consequences. 
<br><br>
Meanwhile, along with China’s enhanced role in Africa is the reality that the U.S. is being increasingly edged out of the continent politically and economically. To compete with the Chinese presence and to counter the negative consequences of China’s approach, the U.S. must become more engaged in Africa with effective strategies. China’s unique approach also has tremendous implications for the U.S. role in global governance and the future of its African partners.<br><br>



Why is it Important for the U.S.?
<br><br>


China’s approach to Africa represents a fundamental challenge to U.S. interests in promoting democracy, good governance and sustainable development in Africa. Chinese funding flows to Africa with “no strings attached,” such as requirements on transparency, anti-corruption, environmental protection, human players in Africa exacerbate the problems through their active endorsement and participation in the flawed process. Therefore, Beijing offers an easy alternative to the principled or disciplined development assistance from the West and multilateral financial institutions, and undercuts the latter’s effort to address the systematic and institutional deficiencies of African countries and to promote long-term sustainable development and democratic systems. <br><br>

Furthermore, China’s engagement in Africa has profound geopolitical implications for the U.S. global strategy. As the U.S. rebalances to the Asia-Pacific region, China has identified increasing hindrances in its strategic advancement in East Asia and the Pacific. In response, China is shifting its attention westward to South Asia, the Middle East and Africa to expand arenas for its political and strategic influence. These areas are seen as the most promising by Beijing given the stagnant or declining U.S. involvement. Especially in Africa, China is looking beyond the traditional pursuit of economic benefits and aspires to increase and solidify its strategic presence through enhanced political, economic, diplomatic and academic resources. The failure to perceive and prepare for China’s moves would be dangerous, unwise and potentially detrimental for the United States in the near future. <br><br>



The Opportunity for the U.S.<br><br>



Given China’s involvement in Africa, there is an even greater need for the U.S. to engage and cooperate with China for its own national interests and global agenda, such as security and governance. Not engaging China in Africa could undercut and even nullify U.S. objectives given China’s approach. Cooperation on security issues, like South Sudan, most likely will not excite China in that China believes the U.S. might ask Beijing to carry a disproportionate share of economic and political responsibility. Furthermore, China worries that a U.S.-China/G-2 approach to African security issues might alienate China’s traditional friendship with African countries since China prefers bilateral or multilateral approaches. <br><br>

Meanwhile, there are key issues on which the U.S. could and should focus. The U.S. needs to raise its concerns and request that China adjust its investment and assistance policies toward Africa through the Africa consultation under the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue. The U.S. needs to better coordinate with China on providing aid, technology and technical support in the fields of health care, and medical and agricultural assistance. Furthermore, inside Africa, the U.S. needs to mobilize its political, diplomatic and soft power influences to mitigate the negative impact of the mercantilist approach of China. Last but not least, a conscious educational effort should be made to help Africa achieve the long-term vision about the consequences of China’s myopic development model.<br><br>


For over a decade now, the continent of Africa,
especially sub-Saharan Africa, has undergone a
major transformation. In 2000, The Economist
referred to Africa as the “Hopeless Continent.” This
nickname was based on an evaluation of the many
disadvantages that characterized the continent:
poverty and disease, cycles of conflict, military and
dictatorial one-party states, etc. Despite large endowments
of natural resources, the continent’s economic
performance was dismal as a result of poor
macroeconomic management and a hostile environment
for doing business.<br><br>
In 2011, The Economist referred to Africa as the
“Rising Continent” and a March 2013 issue of the
magazine contained a special report referring to Africa
as the “Hopeful Continent.” These days, Africa
is variously referred to in positive terms such as
emerging, rising and hopeful. This positive view of
Africa is justified―sub-Saharan Africa is the host of
some of the fastest growing economies in the world.<br><br>
This growth is not just due to rising commodity
prices but is also driven by a more vibrant private
sector supported by an improved business climate.<br><br>
There have also been dramatic improvements in
governance and economic management. The region
has seen major improvements in various sectors of
the economy, especially in services. The information
technology revolution has become an important aspect
of the new Africa, particularly in terms of mobile
technologies. As a result of these developments,
Africa’s middle class is now growing rapidly, and the
continent has become a major market for consumer
goods. While sub-Saharan Africa still faces many
development challenges, it is a far cry from the one

described by The Economist in 2000. Africa is indeed
on the path to claiming the 21st century.<br><br>
With the dramatic changes that have taken place
over the last decade, sub-Saharan Africa has become
increasingly important to the rest of the world. In
the past, relationships for many African countries
were dominated by the former colonial powers. Today,
new players have begun to engage Africa in a
big way. Notably, China and India are investing in
the continent, and increasingly Russia, Brazil, Turkey,
Iran and many others have increased their engagement
with Africa both diplomatically and commercially.<br><br>
The increased interest in Africa by these
new actors has been due to the realization that Africa
has much to offer.<br><br>
In many respects, the United States has been slow
to seize the opportunities availed by the new Africa.<br><br>
While the American private sector has begun to take
advantage of some of these opportunities, the scope
of engagement by American businesses is still small
in scale. Likewise, the U.S. government’s engagement
has not changed much. But Africa matters to
the United States, a reality that will only grow more
important as the continent’s economies and governance
structures continue to transform. While it is
indeed true that Africa benefits from American engagement,
it is also true that the U.S. benefits from
African engagement.<br><br>
The following briefing papers in this collection are
meant to touch on only some of the reasons why Africa
matters for United States as well as strategic opportunities
for U.S. engagement in the region. These briefs focus on five key issues: national security, China,
energy, trade and investment, and U.S. development
assistance.<br><br>
In preparing these papers, the Africa Growth Initiative
hopes to contribute to a better understanding
of Africa for U.S. government policymakers. An
appreciation of the fact that engaging with Africa
benefits both the United States and Africa should be
the foundation for U.S. foreign policy toward Africa.
We believe that a better understanding of the many
reasons why Africa matters to the U.S. should help
American policymakers take a more positive view of
the region in their foreign policy decision-making.<br><br>





The Priority<br><br>
In a complex and globalized security environment,
having strong and capable partners on the African
continent to tackle transnational challenges advances
U.S. national security interests. In this regard, the
growing capabilities of African countries to respond
to regional security challenges are an asset to the
United States. Globally, African nations account for
10 out of the top 20 contributors to United Nations
peacekeeping missions. Furthermore, African countries
and the regional organizations to which they
belong are starting to play a larger role in leading
peacekeeping operations on the continent through
the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM),
the AU-UN Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID)
and the possible African-led International
Support Mission in Mali (AFISMA).<br><br>
These positive developments aside, U.S. efforts to
advance peace and security in Africa face several
challenges. Unable to monitor, interdict and prosecute
predatory actors in their sovereign territories,
many African countries face localized security
challenges that hold the potential for global reach.<br><br>
Transnational organized crime such as the illicit
arms trade and narcotrafficking empowers predatory
actors and increasingly corrupts government and
military officials in West Africa. Piracy and armed
robbery at sea in the Gulf of Guinea and off the coast
of Somalia affect local livelihoods and are detrimental
to global maritime commerce. Violent extremist
organizations (VEOs)―such as al-Qaida in the
Islamic Maghreb, Ansar Dine, and the Movement
for Unity and Jihad in West Africa (all in northern Mali), al-Shabaab in Somalia, and Boko Haram in
Nigeria―jeopardize human security and threaten
to ignite communal violence. As demonstrated by
Ansar al-Sharia’s September 2012 attack on the U.S.
consulate in Benghazi, VEOs pose a threat not only
to the security of U.S. partners in the region, but also
to U.S. citizens. Intrastate conflict remains a security
challenge, with countries like the Central African
Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
Mali and Sudan presently facing new phases of unfrozen,
previously unresolved conflicts. And while
Cote d’Ivoire, Liberia and Sierra Leone have transitioned
from war to peace, similar transitions remain
fragile in Libya, Somalia and South Sudan.<br><br>
Why is it Import ant for the U.S.?<br><br>
The peace and security of the African continent is
increasingly important to the United States for several
reasons. 

First, the security of Africans and of
the countries in which they reside can have an impact
on global security and U.S. interests. African
governments incapable of maintaining sufficient
control over their territories or of fulfilling the basic
needs of their populations can create a permissive
environment for criminal or terrorist networks. <br><br>

Second,
since the establishment of the U.S. Africa Command
(AFRICOM) in 2008, the United States is
playing a greater role in African security―perhaps
in spite of the Department of Defense’s recent efforts
to rebalance toward Asia. One of the cornerstones of
U.S. military engagement in Africa entails assisting
African countries in the management of their own
security challenges through partner capacity building.<br><br>
In an era of declining defense budgets, working with African countries in addressing security challenges
on the continent is an effort to prevent conflict
and share the cost of global security. In principle,
this cooperation ultimately enhances the United
States’ ability to ensure its own national security. Finally,
from a whole of government perspective, the
security of African countries can either support or
undermine U.S. investment in other sectors such as
trade, good governance, health and education.<br><br>
The Opport unity for the U.S.<br><br>
The United States’ ability to advance peace and security
on the continent is contingent on the convergence
of interests with African partners and their
willingness to work with the United States on mutual
security challenges. Accordingly, Congress and
government agencies should consider the following
steps:<br><br>

1. Rebalance U.S. engagement with African
countries so that it is more proactive than
reactive. The United States requires a more
holistic approach to African security―one
that does not solely lie within the domain of
the Department of Defense. Efforts to prevent
and mitigate conflict cut across agencies
and often address some of the root causes
of conflict in Africa. If the United States is
ever to depart from responding to one crisis
after another in Africa, it is imperative that
Congress better resource agencies that have
prominent roles in conflict prevention, such
as the State Department and USAID.<br><br>
2. Establish multi-year funding authorities
for building partner capacity programs.<br><br>
Moving away from episodic engagements
with African countries towards sustained
security partnerships will require that the
authorities that govern security cooperation
become more flexible and streamlined. This
move should help improve the planning of
U.S. military engagement on the continent
and work towards facilitating interagency
coordination.<br><br>







3. Address the deficient capabilities of African
law enforcement personnel. The
training of foreign law enforcement personnel
by the United States is restricted by
Section 660, an amendment to the Foreign
Assistance Act of 1961. Yet, in terms of providing
security for individuals and communities
in Africa, police forces are often the
soft underbelly of African security sectors.<br><br>
Congress should either revisit restrictions
against U.S. engagement on police reform
or should work with European allies to
remedy this capacity gap.<br><br>
4. Continue to support regional and sub-regional
mechanisms for conflict resolution.<br><br>
Although the Economic Community
of West African States (ECOWAS) has
taken the lead in responding to the crises
in Mali, its efforts have been impeded by
limited crisis response planning capabilities,
accompanied by the insufficient military
readiness of several troop-contributing
nations. These deficiencies demonstrate
several opportunities for U.S. assistance to
regional and sub-regional organizations.<br><br>
5. Use ongoing insecurity in the Sahel as an
impetus to re-evaluate the scope of U.S.
military engagement on the continent.<br><br>
The crisis in Mali and the difficulties faced
by African militaries in responding demonstrate
that U.S. engagement with African
militaries may be necessary but insufficient
for stability. Moving forward, the U.S.
should ensure that its engagement in Africa
bolsters non-military pillars of stability and
prioritizes defense sector reform―even if
these efforts occur at the expense of tactical
or technical military capacity-building programs
in the near term.<br><br>

also has tremendous implications for the
U.S. role in global governance and the future of its
African partners.<br><br>
Why is it Import ant for the U.S.?<br><br>
China’s approach to Africa represents a fundamental
challenge to U.S. interests in promoting democracy,
good governance and sustainable development in Africa.<br><br>
Chinese funding flows to Africa with “no strings
attached,” such as requirements on transparency,
anti-corruption, environmental protection, human development and better governance. Chinese players
in Africa exacerbate the problems through their
active endorsement and participation in the flawed
process. Therefore, Beijing offers an easy alternative
to the principled or disciplined development assistance
from the West and multilateral financial institutions,
and undercuts the latter’s effort to address
the systematic and institutional deficiencies of African
countries and to promote long-term sustainable
development and democratic systems.<br><br>
Furthermore, China’s engagement in Africa has profound
geopolitical implications for the U.S. global
strategy. As the U.S. rebalances to the Asia-Pacific
region, China has identified increasing hindrances
in its strategic advancement in East Asia and the
Pacific. In response, China is shifting its attention
westward to South Asia, the Middle East and Africa
to expand arenas for its political and strategic influence.<br><br>
These areas are seen as the most promising by
Beijing given the stagnant or declining U.S. involvement.<br><br>
Especially in Africa, China is looking beyond
the traditional pursuit of economic benefits and aspires
to increase and solidify its strategic presence
through enhanced political, economic, diplomatic
and academic resources. The failure to perceive
and prepare for China’s moves would be dangerous,
unwise and potentially detrimental for the United
States in the near future.<br><br>
The Opport unity for the U.S.<br><br>
Given China’s involvement in Africa, there is an
even greater need for the U.S. to engage and cooperate
with China for its own national interests and
global agenda, such as security and governance. Not engaging China in Africa could undercut and even
nullify U.S. objectives given China’s approach. Cooperation
on security issues, like South Sudan, most
likely will not excite China in that China believes
the U.S. might ask Beijing to carry a disproportionate
share of economic and political responsibility.<br><br>
Furthermore, China worries that a U.S.-China/G-2
approach to African security issues might alienate
China’s traditional friendship with African countries
since China prefers bilateral or multilateral approaches.<br><br>
Meanwhile, there are key issues on which the U.S.
could and should focus. The U.S. needs to raise its
concerns and request that China adjust its investment
and assistance policies toward Africa through
the Africa consultation under the U.S.-China Strategic
and Economic Dialogue. The U.S. needs to better
coordinate with China on providing aid, technology
and technical support in the fields of health care, and
medical and agricultural assistance. Furthermore,
inside Africa, the U.S. needs to mobilize its political,
diplomatic and soft power influences to mitigate
the negative impact of the mercantilist approach of
China. Last but not least, a conscious educational
effort should be made to help Africa achieve the
long-term vision about the consequences of China’s
myopic development model.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T9">Foresight Africa: Top Priorities for the Continent in 2013 </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
非洲的未来（2013的优先抉择）<br><br>

January 2013 <br><br>


Africa starts 2013 with hope and optimism. Africa has dropped its mantle as a “doomed continent” and has weathered several global economic crises fairly well. Today, the continent is a land of opportunity both for Africans and international investors. Many now see the region as “emerging Africa” because of the positive changes that have taken place and continue to take place across the continent.<br><br>

Africa has changed, moving from economic stagnation to above 5 percent GDP growth on average. The continent is now home to some of the fastest growing economies in the world: Ethiopia, Ghana, Mozambique and Tanzania. This growth has helped build a burgeoning middle class, which has created new markets for goods and services. Investors focused on tapping into these new markets in Africa are likely to find it easier to do business there than ever before as African governments are working to reduce transaction costs. In addition to growing consumer markets, African countries have discovered additional natural resources. If managed properly, these resources could help spur further economic growth and development for the region and improve the lives of millions.<br><br>

Such an optimistic outlook for the continent means that African and global policymakers must get ahead of the challenges and opportunities for an important year of decision-making. Since 2010, the Brookings Africa Growth Initiative (AGI) has asked its scholars to assess the top priorities for Africa in the coming year. This year, AGI experts and colleagues have identified what they consider to be the key issues for 2013 and ways to leverage opportunities so that Africa can continue its “emerging” momentum. The following briefs in the Foresight Africa collection are meant to create a dialogue on what matters in Africa for 2013, and it is our hope that this dialogue will continue through the year.<br><br>
