Why Lists of Greatest Battles Don't Work<br><br>
http://nationalinterest.org/<br><br>

 Michael Vlahos  November 4, 2013<br><br>
	
Jim Holmes’ recent “Top Five Naval Battles of All Time” reminds us of what fun we can have handicapping history. But “Pick your Decisive Battles” can also be a mordant game. My Naval War College colleague implicitly reveals the unnoticed, darker fallacies to our strategic thinking―the kind that can lead to lost wars.<br><br>

The first fallacy is our unconscious enshrining of “decisive battle”―not as in, “I won big”―but “I won history and changed the fate of nations, and the course of civilization, to boot”―in one battle. Jim shows us we actually still think this way.<br><br>

There are actually a very few battles that meet this test: Hülegü’s sack of Baghdad in 1258 comes to mind. But the proliferation of “decisive”―as Jim suggests―may speak more of our bipolar search for, and simultaneous diminution of, ordinary significance in life than it does the role of decisive battles in history.<br><br>

But such battles are even harder to find at sea.<br><br>

Jim points out how Trafalgar’s very decisiveness requires long and elaborate invocations of Mahanian naval theology. It speaks to his own probity that he does not include Trafalgar in his “big five.” But what about his “decisive” picks?<br><br>

Just consider Lepanto and The Armada, for example. Titian, Tintoretto, Vicentino and Veronese propaganda-paintings aside, Lepanto actually failed to “assure European, not Ottoman, command of the middle sea.” What it did assure was a renewed and vigorous Ottoman sea offensive, including the completed conquest of Cyprus, the wresting of Tunis from Spain, and the capture of Fez. Nor did Ottoman seapower thereafter quickly recede. From 1645-1669 the Porte leveraged Crete, jewel of the Venetian seaborne empire, from the grasp of the greatest Mediterranean navy of all. Even as late as 1715, the Ottomans retook Morea (the Peloponnesus) from Venice, fighting their fleets to a virtual standstill. So the middle sea, from Morocco to Otranto to the Dardanelles, plus the whole of the Black Sea, was still ruled by Ottoman fleets and corsairs for a long, long time after Lepanto.<br><br>

The Armada seems equally “slam-dunk” decisive to us today. Like Lepanto, a fleet is destroyed, with 20,000 casualties: what could be worse? But unlike the Holy League, the English tried to follow up their victory with an expedition just as big as the Armada, launched against Spanish Lisbon. It was, as my son would say, an “epic fail.” The Spanish Armada (1588) and the English Armada (1589) suffered, at 20,000 each and scores of foundered ships, equal losses. Spain remained one of the big three sea powers, and totally effective defending its world empire―for two more centuries. So there is something decisive here?<br><br>

Let’s face up to what “Pick Your Decisive Battles” is really all about. It is not simply an amusing “bloodsport.” Far from a Boy’s Club diversion, it is more sinister (or at least more cynical) entertainment altogether.<br><br>

No joke. Look at how recent bestselling books in history―say, on Lepanto―are marketed. “The Contest for the Center of the World” one 2009 potboiler trumpets, while another in 2008 just puts it out there: Victory of the West: The Great Christian-Muslim Clash. The Armada is only different because here it is the battle royale between Western forces for the future: The dark way of Spanish autocracy, on one hand, and the plucky forces of light, of Anglo-Saxonica, on the other.
<br><br>
Only a wildly entertaining sleight-of-hand lets us believe battles are “decisive”―and the sleight-of-hand is this: The game makes defeat about the world itself being lost. If the “bad guys” had won at Lepanto, we would all be Muslims today; if the Armada had succeeded, we would all be speaking Spanish and crossing ourselves daily.<br><br>

The deeper game emerges. A battle is decisive if “it decides the fate of civilizations, empires, or great nations.” Churchill’s “hinge of fate” tells us that decisive battles could have gone the other way―and not just on the field, but with superbad historical consequences.<br><br>

At Lepanto the Ottoman fleet should have crushed the Holy League as badly as it was itself crushed by them. But then, on top of that, the (less-than-magnificent) Sultan Selim II could have rushed full-throttle into Italy and made Rome a protected Islamic fiefdom.<br><br>

Hence, at Gravelines, the Spanish fleet should have smashed English galleons and then landed Parma and his army on Kentish soil. But then, with a wave of the hand, that army could have overturned England and stayed fully resupplied by sea, while also maintaining its iron grip on the Spanish Netherlands in absentia.<br><br>

Please tell how this could have been done. No Ottoman army could have survived in Italy, let alone quickly conquered it. Logistics from the Balkans made such an enterprise an instant loser, and the tercios would have wiped out such a forlorn army. Moreover, Ottoman defeat in Italy would have been far more shameful than a temporary and easily requited loss at sea.<br><br>

Equally, the Protestant cause would actually have benefitted from a Spanish military lodgment in Kent, because the wily Duke of Parma would have at last been cornered. Thus the Dutch-Calvinist cause could have split Spanish forces and cemented their doom. Instead of merely gaining independence (in 1640), they might even have expelled Spain entirely from the Netherlands by 1600. Spain dodged a strategic bullet by losing their Armada.<br><br>

What we have codified in literary canon as “fate of civilization” moments are instead merely tokens―if useful tokens―that a big military enterprise has reached its limit, and maybe should just stop. Like the old saw: “Death is nature’s way of telling you to slow down;” what we cherish as “decisive battles” are really just flags and signposts not to go any farther.<br><br>

The Ottomans had some natural strategic limits. There is a reason they besieged Vienna twice: It was the end of the road. On spring-summer campaign, their armies could never get further than Hungary-Podolia, or Azerbaijan-Tabriz. Italy was never seriously in the cards. Never―and Lepanto was its message.<br><br>

Likewise the Spanish Habsburgs had their hands full for eighty years doing “whack-a-mole” in the Netherlands. England, whose former queen had actually been married to Philip II, may have seemed to him like a solution waiting for a Spanish tercio or two. But this was way over his limit. The Armada was his stand-down message.<br><br>

Battles at sea that send this message seem a far cry from Jim’s definition of “decisive.” Yet there have been decisive naval battles: Battles that not only have the whole literary thing going―but the whole real thing going too. I can think of two.<br><br>

The Arab (Umayyad) assault on Constantinople in 717-718 was in large part turned back by Byzantine naval power. Here it just might have gone the other way, and here a Muslim victory would surely have had incalculable consequences for our civilization.<br><br>

Why? Because Constantinople was unique: It was the last place, the Helm’s Deep of antiquity, and thus the final repository, not only of Greco-Roman civilization’s artifacts, but also of its institutions, way of life, and way of thinking. Had it fallen, at a time when there were no other places to pick up the pieces and provide us continuity: Things, big things in history, might have well been different.<br><br>

The second decisive battle was a naval battle the U.S. lost decisively. It is called Pearl Harbor. I am still amazed that students deny that Pearl Harbor was a naval battle. It is perhaps in the religious nature of American exceptionalism that such shameful events have eternal dispensation from sin―as long as you call it a “sneak attack.”<br><br>

This, and all of this, I fully understand. But Pearl Harbor was a decisive naval battle. It was the fatal juncture that forever altered the course of America, but more significantly, of Japanese civilization. By taking this path, Japan led itself into a vale of tears that has persisted all the decades since the war, and from which the Japanese people and nation have not emerged. By any objective measure, this was the decisive naval engagement of modernity.<br><br>

Thus, the biggest missing piece in any discussion of “decisive battle” is the struggle over significance in identity. Great dramatic moments of triumph and transcendence, retold as heroic stories, fill that need.<br><br>

But “decisive battle” is also a sell-job for the war-enterprise itself. The whole linkage of decisive battle with “destined for greatness” also insists that our national identity must be fulfilled in battle. Everything that actually happened is relevant only if it sustains this grand and slightly sacred narrative. Everything depends on how the narrative is spun. Hence Trafalgar is still central to the narrative of British identity, just as Midway and D-Day are to Americans, or even as Lepanto books were during The Great Muslim-American war of the first decade of this century―spinning their message of Christian victory over Muslim “bad guys.”<br><br>

My difficulty with the game of “Pick Your Decisive Battle” is less about telling history than it is about twisting history into a series of moralizing tales: About which nations are “destined for greatness” (or as Japan above, eternal infamy), just like they were stories from the Bible. Endlessly repeating every glorious moment becomes a ritual of reaffirmation.<br><br>

Of course such rituals are needed now especially in the shadowy aftermath of our “long war” and its wreckage, where no “decisive battle” will ever rise from the ashes. In fact I can find no decisive victory of American arms since 1945―even Inchon and Desert Storm―that did not also end quickly in historical wreckage for us.<br><br>

Maybe we need this game after all―But let us not play it eyes wide shut.<br><br>

Top Five Naval Battles of All Time<br><br>


 
James Holmes  October 5, 2013<br><br>

Ranking battles by their importance has been a bloodsport among military historians as long as there have been military historians. Creasy's classic Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World(1851) set the standard for the genre.<br><br>

But what makes a battle decisive? And what makes one such test of arms more important than another?<br><br>

Defining the term too loosely produces howlers like a recent US News catalogue of decisive battles of the American Civil War. By the US News count, 45 engagements qualified as decisive during that four-year struggle alone. Zounds!<br><br>

The term must be defined less cavalierly than that to be meaningful. If every battle is decisive, no battle is. That's one reason I always ask students whether some legendary triumph―a Trafalgar, or a Tsushima Strait―was decisive, or just dramatic, or just featured the star power of a Nelson or Togo.<br><br>

Even the masters of strategy, however, appear ambivalent about what constitutes decisive victory. Carl von Clausewitz supplies a working definition, describing a decisive engagement as one that leads directly to peace. This implies an action carrying not just tactical but strategic and political import. Such an encounter impels the vanquished to accept the victor's terms at the bargaining table, whether because he's no longer capable of fighting on, believes he stands little chance of turning the tables and winning, or estimates that victory will prove unaffordable. A decisive battle, in this expansive interpretation, is the chief determinant of a war's outcome.<br><br>

So far, so good. But how direct must direct be for a battle to earn the lofty status of decisive? Must peace talks take place immediately following the clash of arms that precipitates them? Can a settlement come weeks or months afterward, so long as the cause/effect relationship is clear? What's the time horizon?<br><br>

The great Carl is silent on such matters. It's possible he's too casual about them. Combat, methinks, can be decisive while achieving more modest goals than winning a war outright. To see how, interpret the word literally: something decisive decides something. (Admittedly, this is probably how the US News team got in trouble. Every action decides something in a tactical sense, no matter how mundane or inconsequential. If nothing else, it determines who holds the field of battle at day's end, or reveals that the fighting stalemated. This says little about its larger meaning, if any.) Armed clashes can yield decisive results on different levels of war. A tactical encounter could decide the outcome of a campaign or the fate of a combat theater without leading directly to peace. Right?<br><br>

In short, it appears wise to define a decisive victory more three-dimensionally than Clausewitz does, namely as a trial of arms that lets a belligerent accomplish some positive or negative aim beyond mere tactical results. Winning the war would still qualify, obviously, but the broader view would allow historians to rate a Battle of Trafalgar as decisive.<br><br>

Fought in 1805, Trafalgar scarcely brought about final peace with Napoleonic France. That took another decade of apocalyptic warfare. But it did settle whether the French could invade the British Isles and, through amphibious conquest, crush the offshore threat to French supremacy. The heroics of Nelson, Collingwood, and their shipmates decided the outcome of Napoleon's scheme while enabling Great Britain to persevere with the struggle. Trafalgar, then, directly accomplished the negative goal of keeping French legions from invading Britain. That must qualify as decisive in the operational sense.<br><br>

Speaking of pugilism on the briny main, here's another wrinkle in this debate. Clausewitz says next to nothing about maritime conflict. Water barely exists in his writings. Fin de siecle historian Sir Julian Corbett, the best in the business of sea-power theory, doubts naval warfare is ever decisive by itself, except perhaps through gradual exhaustion. Close or distant blockades, however, grind down not just the enemy but your allies and your own businessfolk who rely on seaborne trade. They impose costs on everyone.<br><br>

Like Clausewitz, Corbett thus seems skeptical about the decisiveness of any single engagement. Sure, a dominant seafaring state can and must make the sea a barrier to invasion and other direct assaults on its homeland. That's the Trafalgar model. At its bottom, though, maritime strategy is the art of determining the relations between the army and navy in a plan of war. It's ultimately about shaping affairs on land, which, after all, is where people live. But how do you rank a purely naval engagement on the high seas against an army/navy operation that unfolds at the interface between land and sea?<br><br>

Tough question. So there's a lot to ponder in the seemingly simple question, what is decisive? To rank naval battles against one another, let's assign a pecking order among degrees of decisiveness. Derring-do, tactical artistry, or gee-whiz technology are not among the criteria. Nor are lopsided tactical results enough to lift an encounter into the upper echelon. That's why the Battle of Tsushima, which left wreckage from the Russian Baltic Fleet littering the Yellow Sea floor in 1905, doesn't make my list.<br><br>

Topping my list are naval actions that decided the fates of civilizations, empires, or great nations. This is decisiveness of the first order. Such encounters stand in a category apart. Next come engagements that reversed the momentum in a conflict of world-historical importance. They set the endgame in motion, even if a long time elapsed between the battle and the peace settlement it helped set in motion. Direct needn't mean fast. And if battles meeting one of those standards don't exhaust the field―read on to find out―last come tests of arms that settled the outcome in a particular theater of war, helping set the stage for eventual victorious peace.<br><br>

So, this leaves us with a rough hierarchy of sea fights. The more fateful and enduring a battle's ramifications, the higher it stands on the list. All of which is a roundabout way of getting to my Top Five Naval Battles in World History. In order from least to most important:<br><br>


5. Lepanto (1571). The Battle of Lepanto stemmed the westward spread of Ottoman power across the Mediterranean Sea. With papal sanction, the Holy League, a consortium of Catholic seafaring states, assembled a navy to engage the main Ottoman fleet in the Gulf of Corinth, off western Greece. Lepanto was the last major all-galley naval engagement in the Mediterranean. The League put its advantages in gunnery and ship types―notably the galleass, an outsized galley bearing heavy armament―to good use against the Turkish fleet, which disgorged far less weight of shot. The Ottomans lost the bulk of their vessels to enemy action. More importantly, they lost experienced crews. They found that regenerating human capital isn't as easy as fitting out wooden men-of-war. Shipwrights soon built new hulls, letting the Turkish navy reassert its supremacy in the Eastern Mediterranean for a period. By 1580, however, the new navy was left to rot at its moorings. Galley warfare assured permanent European, not Ottoman, command of the middle sea. That's a decisive result by any measure.<br><br>

4. Battle of Yamen (1279). Sometimes dubbed “China’s Trafalgar,” this clash between the Mongol Yuan Dynasty and the beleaguered Southern Song determined who would rule China for nearly a century. It was far more decisive than Horatio Nelson’s masterwork. Over one thousand warships crewed by tens of thousands of men took part in the engagement. Yuan commanders deployed deception and bold tactics to overcome at least a 10:1 mismatch in numbers. Most important, Yamen claimed the life of the Song emperor, clearing the way for Kublai Khan’s dynasty to take charge of Asia's central kingdom. The results of Yamen thus reverberated throughout Asia for decades afterward.<br><br>


3. Quiberon Bay (1759). The year 1759 has been called a year of miracles for Great Britain. Land and naval operations determined whether Britain or France would emerge triumphant in North America. British troops under Wolfe subdued Montcalm's defenders at Quebec and Montreal, sealing the fate of New France. France stood little chance of recouping its fortunes because Admiral Sir Edward Hawke's Royal Navy fleet ventured into Quiberon Bay that November―in a westerly gale, no less―and put paid to the French fleet in its home waters. Having wrested away command of Atlantic shipping lanes, Britain could bar access to the Americas. Lesson: to score decisive victories, hire commanders with fighting names like Wolfe and Hawke. British exploits settled the destiny of a continent while setting a pattern for North American politics that persists to this day.<br><br>

2. Spanish Armada (1588). This was the duke of Medina Sidonia's purportedly invincible fleet, ordered by Spain's King Philip II to cross the Channel and land in England. There Spanish forces would unseat England's Queen Elizabeth I. By installing a friendly regime, the expeditionary force would terminate English support for the Dutch revolt roiling the Spanish Netherlands while ending English privateering against Spanish shipping. The Catholic Philip sought and obtained papal approval for the enterprise against the Protestant Elizabeth. Weather, however, conspired with English seamanship and gunnery tactics to condemn the expedition. The Spanish host was unable to land. Instead Medina Sidonia found himself compelled to circumnavigate the British Isles under foul conditions to reach home port. The failed cross-Channel crusade heartened the English crown. Had the Armada replaced a Protestant with a Catholic monarch, it's conceivable that the British Empire never would have been founded―and certainly not in the form it actually took. How would Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Ocean history have unfolded then? The implications of that question boggle the mind―and qualify the Armada's defeat as decisive in the largest sense.<br><br>

1. Salamis (480 B.C.). Taken in tandem with its immediate precursors, the sea battle of Artemisium and the land battle at Thermopylae, the Battle of Salamis was part of a joint campaign that would gladden Corbett's heart. Themistocles, the founder of the Athenian navy, led an outnumbered, outmanned allied fleet against King Xerxes' Persian armada. Artemisium kept Persian sea forces from linking up with the colossal horde that had crossed the Hellespont and was lumbering overland through Greece, with the ultimate goal of conquering Europe. Themistocles' fleet then retired to the waters off Salamis Island to defend the Athenian populace, which had abandoned its city to the Persians. Guile and artful tactics let the allies overcome Persian numbers in this narrow sea. If not for Spartan and Athenian audacity, at sea as on shore, Xerxes may have throttled Western civilization in its infancy. Fending off the Great King's onslaught entitles Salamis to enduring fame. It was the most decisive naval battle in history.<br><br>

Needless to say, drawing up a list like this one is tough. Many worthy candidates ended up on the cutting-room floor. China's Ming Dynasty was born through inland naval warfare, at the Battle of Lake Poyang (1363). The Battle of the Virginia Capes (1781) doomed Lord Cornwallis' army at Yorktown and assured American independence. The naval battles at Guadalcanal (1942-1943) reversed the tide of war in the Pacific, while the Battle of the Philippine Sea (1944) doomed Japanese naval aviation―paving the way for history's last major fleet engagement, at Leyte Gulf later that year. None, however, compares to the top five for world-historic significance.<br><br>

Lastly, it's fun and enlightening to speculate about the dogs that didn't bark. About, that is, the naval engagements of immense consequence that could have, and perhaps should have, yet never did take place. For instance, the U.S. Navy just celebrated the bicentennial of the Battle of Lake Erie. Despite the dismal results of the War of 1812, small-scale engagements such as Lake Erie and the Battle of New Orleans impressed the British leadership with the United States' latent military and naval strength. Trivial-seeming U.S. victories implanted the idea among British statesmen that a conciliatory policy toward Washington was more prudent than trying to outmatch a republic predestined for primacy in North America and its marine environs.<br><br>

Why the rise of America didn't produce a cataclysmic naval war with the supreme sea power of the day is worth mulling over. But that, as they say, is a story for another day.<br><br>

中国的智库也解决不了问题<br><br>

何谓智库：谋士、门客、谏议大夫<br><br>

智库，英文称“ThinkTank”，即智囊机构，也称“思想库”。指由专家组成的，多学科的，为决策者处理社会、经济、科技、军事、外交等各方面问题出谋划策，提供最佳理论、策略、方法、思想等的公共研究机构，是影响政府决策和推动社会发展的一支重要力量。中国古代对智库的称谓，有智囊、养士、军师、谋士、门客、幕僚、谏议大夫、师爷等。<br><br>

中国智库构成：官方、学院、民间<br><br>

早在新中国成立之后的五六十年代，就有一部分有识之士通过新闻媒体“内参”的模式影响过高层决策，而最早出现的“智囊机构”，可能是1980年开始形成的“中国农村发展问题研究组”，该机构成员通过调研形成的报告，为1981年中央农村工作会议准备了系统而全面的第一手农村调查数据。1984年起，该机构被一分为三，人员分别进入隶属于国家体改委的中国经济体制改革研究所、隶属于国务院农村发展研究中心的发展研究所，以及社科院农发所。<br><br>

进入90年代，另外一些智囊机构开始出现，如后来被整合为国务院发展研究中心的若干个研究中心，中信国际研究所等等。同时，随着经济活动的复杂化和研究领域的精细化，各个中央部委如农业部、财政部、中国人民银行等纷纷设立了自己的研究机构，各重点高校属下的研究机构也越来越积极地参与政府政策研究和政策咨询工作。即使在以前被认为敏感的外交和两岸关系领域，也出现了大大小小几十个智库。<br><br>

据统计，中国现有研究机构2500多家，专职研究人员3.5万人，工作人员27万人。其中，以政策研究为核心、直接或间接为政府服务的“智库型”研究机构达2000家。<br><br>

智库的分类：第一类是中共中央、国务院及军队的直属智库机构。如中央政策研究室、国务院发展研究中心、军事科学院等机构。第二类是中央和国务院各部委下设的研究机构。如国家发改委宏观经济研究院、财政部财政科学研究所、国家信息中心等。第三类是高校系统。如北京大学中国经济研究中心、清华大学国情研究中心等。此外，一些民间智库如雨后春笋拔地而起，出现了诸如天则经济研究所、中国世界与政治研究所、安邦集团等渐为公众熟知的民间知名智库。其研究成果及报告亦开始出现在政府决策高层及广大民众的面前。<br><br>

2009年3月20日在北京成立的一家高级智库――中国国际经济交流中心，其理事长由原国务院副总理曾培炎“出山”担任。这个新智库是温家宝总理亲自批示成立的，整合了原来国家发改委下属的国际合作中心和对外开放咨询中心两大智库。<br><br>



中国智库面临的困境：官方智库缺乏独立性、学院智库与社会脱离、民间智库身份尴尬<br><br>

在多位专家看来，国内各种类型智库的缺陷已经日渐明显。<br><br>

一些官方智库体制内的生存模式，摆脱不了既做裁判员又做运动员的双重角色，由于其生存发展受到上级主管部门影响，怎样提出最科学的研究成果就不一定是其考虑的重点，更多承担了对政策维护和解释功能。<br><br>

大学智库那种象牙塔式的研究成果与社会实践往往存在一定的差距，加上政府本身对自身决策咨询机构和官方智库的信任和依赖，多数大学智库对政府决策部门而言处于可有可无的状态。<br><br>

民间智库完全处于市场之中，自筹资金、自负盈亏。由于作为智库产品主要需求方的政府在思想产品采购上很少甚至没有引入市场竞争机制，处于政府体制外的民间智库生存空间狭小。与西方成熟的思想市场机制相比，中国智库还处于计划经济阶段。民间智库批判手段的不当运用是造成其生存发展陷入困境的重要原因，导致其与政府之间缺乏正常通畅的对话交流机制。<br><br>

在诸多影响下，评论者也对中国智库的一些“拙劣的表现”提出了批评。<br><br>

财经评论员叶檀：从2007年到2008年的经济运行情况看，学者之前的预测多数是错误的。这个问题的原因有两个方面：一方面，的确是研究人员水平差，业务不熟练，甚至连一些基本的概念都没有厘清，对基本的经济规律缺乏认知。另一方面，绝大多数人还不至于犯这样的错误，我认为是他们对自己的定位错了。研究者提供的应该是对未来经济有依据的科学判断，但是由于我国多数是体制内的研究者，所以研究者的职责在多数情况下就变成了为现有的政策作解释。或者是根据需要作出相应的预期，完全偏离了客观公正的研究态度。<br><br>

清华大学国际传播研究中心主任李希光：中国的国内政策是中国特色社会主义、人民代表大会、民主协商，到国外却变成了没人权、没自由、政治不透明；经济政策是经济改革、可持续性发展和环境保护，到国外也失真为受管制的市场经济、破坏气候和不鼓励竞争；外交政策是睦邻外交，在国外被歪曲为支持失败国家、非洲新殖民者、威胁日本……中国的软实力在智库这种非政府组织方面面对着巨大的亏空。<br><br>

中国智库未来的发展<br><br>

世界一流智库是如何运作的？它们如何避免中国智库在发展中遇到的类似制约？<br><br>

美国卡内基国际和平基金会高级研究员裴敏欣介绍，美国的智库基本都是民间的，且一般为非营利机构，依靠基金会资助，所以在资金上问题不大。其次，美国智库有自己专门的研究人员，一般都是各学科的专家，或者有着丰富政治经验的前政府高官。此外，智库之所以在美国兴盛，还取决于政府决策机制的开放性，这样智库才能够充分地参与到政府决策过程中去；还有良好的舆论环境，因为智库的研究成果需要通过媒体的平台来展示。<br><br>

和卡内基类似，被视为现代智库之父的美国兰德公司虽然在2002年取消了“公司”的名称，但无论取消前还是取消后，它的组织框架和业务模式完全不是普通的商业公司，而是一个通过研究分析，推动政策和决策改善的非营利机构。它的研究报告的主要“买家”，是美国政府及其下属部门。<br><br>

薛澜认为，对中国智库未来的发展而言，两个方面的问题值得考虑：一是如何完善智库发展所赖以生存的“政策分析市场”，二是如何加强智库的自身建设。<br><br>

在完善智库发展的“政策分析市场”方面，要建立政策分析研究的需求方和供给方交流的渠道，使相关智库对政策研究的需求非常清楚，各种智库可以针对相关政策研究的需要，进行深入的研究并提出相关政策建议。其次，要逐渐保证智库研究经费的多元化。有了多渠道的、充足的研究资金来源，研究机构保持独立性的可能性就会提高，因此，在中国设立政府的政策研究基金，通过法律或政策鼓励社会公益捐助等都是有效的制度基础。再次，要建立智库研究成果多层次输出和公开讨论的机制。智库的研究成果不仅向政府部门输出，还必须以各种形式向其他关心该政策问题的公众和社会团体提供，使智库通过丰富多样的方式实现其政策影响力。<br><br>

就当前中国智库发展状况而言，无论在政治环境、舆论环境、人才资源、资金保障还是社会需求上，都是中国智库的黄金时代。智库不但成为中国媒体和公众耳熟能详的流行词汇，而且也逐渐真正成为政治决策、国际传播、公共外交中的一个重要力量。<br><br>


中国十大著名智库首次集体公开亮相<br><br>
 2006年11月09日  中国新闻网<br><br>

　　中新网11月9日电 在日前于北京召开的中国首届智库论坛上，长期为中国决策层提供政策和咨询、却一直披着神秘面纱的十大中国著名“智库”终于浮出水面。香港《大公报》发自北京的报道说，这也是中国智库首次公开集体亮相。<br><br>

报道说，十大智库排名是由国内知名的科研院校、学者专家和智业机构，根据这些智库为国家决策提供的政策和咨询的多寡，以及其提供的咨询在国家的政治、经济、文化、军事、外交等领域产生的影响而评出的。这些智库大多属于半官方机构，隶属政府不同部门，在政府决策过程中，均曾发挥过重要作用。<br><br>

　　其中，中国社会科学院、国务院发展研究中心，是中央和国务院的主要智囊机构，从全国网罗了一批社科和经济方面的专家学者，长期以来，在国家内政外交政策制定方面，发挥着重要作用。中国现代国际关系研究院、中国国际问题研究所、中国太平洋经济合作全国委员会、上海国际问题研究所等，则侧重于外交政策的研究。随着中国国际地位的提升以及近年来积极外交政策的推动，这些以研究对外关系为主的研究所显得日益重要，并直接为国家的外交决策提供智力支持。<br><br>

　　中国军事科学院和中国国际战略学会则属于军方决策智库，为中国的军事战略，以及中国军队未来的建设与发展走向提供决策。<br><br>

　　报道介绍，目前对政府有影响力的研究成果，不少是智库承接的政府课题。<br><br>

　　报道说，有专家指出，十大智库的集体亮相，必将推动中国各类研究机构的发展，中国智库与政府间的互动势必也将进一步加强和紧密。专家并建议，应大力扶持民间智库的发展，形成百家争鸣的格局，为国家宏观政策和战略发展提供强有力的政策保证。(杨清林)<br><br>

习近平智囊刘鹤:为三任总书记起草经济讲稿<br><br>
2013年11月01日   廉政t望 <br><br>
刘鹤：你对中国究竟有多重要？<br><br>

　　文 连中<br><br>

　　今年5月，国家主席习近平曾向来访的美国国家安全顾问多尼隆介绍身边的一位“身材高大、有着学者风度的助手”，说：“这是刘鹤，他对我非常重要。”该报道认为，刘鹤的工作是“勾勒中国的经济前景，而这一前景将指导中国未来10年的行进方向”。<br><br>

　　作为中央财经领导小组办公室主任、国家发改委副主任，62岁的刘鹤曾参与多项国家改革方略设计，被外界认为是中国经济政策的核心智囊，未来中国经济发展的理论“操盘手”。<br><br>

　　然而，对于外界，尤其是外媒的赞誉，刘鹤非常低调。他的办公室在回复《华尔街日报》的电子邮件时表示，刘鹤认为外界对自己在中国经济政策制定方面扮演的角色有许多误解，中国的经济政策是通过一个集体决策体系制定的，任何个人发挥的作用都是相当有限的。<br><br>

　　“顶层设计”发明人<br><br>

　　也有人注意到，在大众眼中，刘鹤其实没有他的那些发明那么有名。比如现在叫得很响的“顶层设计”一词，就出于他的构想。<br><br>

　　“顶层设计”这个名词最早来自信息产业，出现在“十二五”规划纲要中，时任国务院信息化工作办公室副主任的刘鹤全程参与了该纲要的起草过程。他对此名词是这样解释的：“顶层设计包括基本的价值取向、要达到的主要目的，以及先后顺序。因为中国已经过了东试一下西试一下的阶段。”<br><br>

　　刘鹤在上世纪90年代初提出过一个著名观点：未来20年驱动世界经济增长的力量只有两个，中国的城市化和发达国家高技术的扩张。这个观点在很多场合多次被他提及。<br><br>

　　事实上，刘鹤很早就已经是中国经济政策的制定者与参与者之一。刘鹤在国务院发展研究中心期间主笔的《中国产业政策的初步研究》报告，受到国务院负责人的高度重视，因此被调到国家计委从事产业政策工作。<br><br>

　　在国家计委工作期间，刘鹤主持制定了11个国家产业政策，其中5个由国务院正式对外颁布。他参与了“八五”计划、“九五”计划和“十五”计划，还参与“十二五”规划编制，同时还是十六届三中、五中、六中全会和十七大、十七届四中、五中全会文件重要执笔人。<br><br>

　　有政策研究人士称，近年来的一些重大经济政策，都能在刘鹤的论著和言论中看出端倪。<br><br>

　　其中，流传颇广的一种说法是，2008年，金融海啸即将横扫世界，时任国务院总理的温家宝派刘鹤同哈佛大学的一组专家会面，商谈应对之策。参与该次会面的哈佛大学教授托尼・赛奇回忆称，刘鹤的使命是向温家宝介绍美国陷入金融危机的深度。<br><br>

　　无人知晓刘鹤在给中国最高决策层的报告中谈了什么，但是7周后，中国应对金融危机的“4万亿”经济刺激计划重磅出台。<br><br>

　　本届政府放在重要位置上的城镇化战略，也出现在刘鹤2006年的一封“锦囊”里。他于当年发表《拉美经济的主要挑战和经验教训》一文，认为拉美经济的主要问题是大量原农牧业劳动者未能被现代经济部门吸纳，导致城乡二元结构固化；并建议中国稳步推进城市化，发展服务业和非国有经济，避免拉美化。<br><br>

　　为三任总书记起草经济讲稿<br><br>

　　中财办是负责经济工作的最高议事机构，参与负责有关中央经济工作会议和五年规划报告等重要文件的起草。港媒称刘鹤为财经文胆中的老兵，已为三任中共中央总书记起草经济讲稿。<br><br>

　　一些熟悉刘鹤的人戏称其为“工农兵加海归”，这样的背景有助于像刘鹤这样的政策制定者既对中国情况有接地气的认知，又具有宽广的国际视野。<br><br>

　　1952年出生于北京的刘鹤，曾就读于北京著名的101中学，据凤凰网报道，当时刘鹤和习近平在这里就已相互熟识。和千千万万的青年一样，刘鹤后来参加了“上山下乡”，被安排到吉林插队。<br><br>

　　刘鹤的知青生涯并不长，一年以后他加入中国人民解放军的王牌军――38军，中国的知名房地产商任志强、电影导演冯小刚均出自这支军队。<br><br>

　　3年后，刘鹤退伍，回城在北京无线电厂当工人，后转为干部。<br><br>

　　恢复高考后，他于1978年考入人民大学工业经济系，先后获得学士、管理硕士学位。1993年毕业于美国Seton Hall大学工商管理学院，1995年在美国哈佛大学肯尼迪政府学院获MPA学位。<br><br>

　　哈佛大学的肯尼迪学院是世界上最顶尖的以研究政策、培养精英官员的学府，世界各国政府都选拔优秀官员前去受训。资料显示，早在1996年，就有60名中国政府官员在肯尼迪政府学院受训，到目前为止，肯尼迪政府学院受训过的中国高级官员已经超过1000人。<br><br>

　　这样的背景让刘鹤与学界交流较多。1998年6月，他创办了“中国经济50人论坛”。该论坛成员包括吴敬琏、樊纲等中国一流经济学家，5名成员当选中共十八届中央委员、2名当选候补委员，其中包括新任财政部部长楼继伟等。<br><br>

　　该论坛经常举办学术会议，研讨重大经济问题。据知情人士称，论坛得出的结论常上报给中央财经办。而论坛的年会主题，更是紧扣国内外经济大势，常被视作中国重大经济政策的“沙盘推演”。<br><br>

　　“从组织‘50人论坛’开始，刘鹤的特点就很明显。”吴敬琏认为，“他能鼓励学者们发挥专长，独立地对经济问题发表咨询性意见，长于集思广益。”<br><br>

　　1999年刘鹤和马云在北京大学对话，马云当年正办阿里巴巴，被舆论称是“老兵和小兵对话，刘具有政治宿将气质，不显山不露水，低头做人，高调做事，绝不搅在旋涡中心，绝不跟人产生正面冲突”。<br><br>

　　刘鹤还能改变什么？<br><br>

　　之前有报道称，即将拉开帷幕的十八届三中全会，将讨论完善社会主义市场经济体制的有关意见，该会议将从顶层设计的角度，确定下一步的改革路线图。<br><br>

　　观察人士指出，经济改革关键部门的掌舵者都是改革派，如央行行长周小川、财政部长楼继伟和中财办主任刘鹤等，这有助于减轻改革的阻力。<br><br>

　　据悉，由刘鹤发起的“50人经济论坛”举行的各种会议，已经为十八届三中全会报告起草做了很多准备工作。<br><br>

　　华盛顿布鲁金斯学会研究中国问题的学者李成表示，大约几个月前，刘鹤已经把7个“研究小组”集合在一起，研究金融自由化、财政政策、放松管制、城镇化和地权等问题。<br><br>

　　参与了相关工作的学术人士透露，今年9月中旬之前，刘鹤的团队一直努力将7份报告连贯成一个整体。<br><br>

　　以今年2月17日举行的，主题围绕改革的重点任务和路径的“50人论坛年会”为例，多名著名学者呼吁将成立国家改革委员会的建议上报中央，以解决顶层设计和改革推动的问题，引起重大反响。刘鹤认为，从问题入手的导向办法，可以找到下一步改革的路径。<br><br>

　　10月8日，有业内人士对外界表示，“除了作为中央领导人的建议者之外，他(刘鹤)本身对于政策的制定有很大影响”，而在即将面世的中国经济改革蓝图中，金融领域有望迎来实质性“动刀”。从其公开言论来看，刘鹤一贯积极主张改革，特别强调增长模式转型和结构调整。<br><br>

　　在刘鹤的领导下，中央财经领导小组办公室在搜寻经济信息方面亲力亲为。山东省官员透露，今年6月初，刘鹤派检查人员前往山东省，了解大型工业公司的状况，其中包括一家卡车生产商和一家信息技术公司。<br><br>

　　评论则认为，如今那个下过乡的知青已经成为中国经济蓝图的起草者，他的改革思路将影响中国的未来。<br><br>

　　他一方面被认为是坚定的市场派改革者，又在推出4万亿刺激计划中扮演过重要角色，而这一刺激计划如今受到广泛的质疑。在中共十八届三中全会召开前夕，刘鹤作为中国改革蓝图的起草者，将对中国改革的未来产生重大影响。<br><br>

刘鹤，1952年出生于北京。早在60年代，刘鹤和习近平两人在北京101中学上学时就已经相识。<br><br>
1969年到1970年，在吉林插队<br><br>
18岁到21岁：中国人民解放军的王牌军――38军，中国的知名房地产商任志强、电影导演冯小刚均出自这只军队。<br><br>
##编者老爸也曾在54军服役，虽不曾有上述辉煌。但军人就是军人，还是与众不同的。##<br><br>
1976年，时年24岁的刘鹤进入中国人民大学学习，1986年获得硕士学位，其间他还与人翻译了《经济发展理论的十位大师》一书，开始研究中国的发展路径问题。<br><br>
1992至1993年，在美国Seton Hall大学工商管理学院毕业；<br><br>
1994年至1995年，在美国哈佛大学肯尼迪学院获MPA学位，兼梅森项目研究员。<br><br>
2001年至2003年，任国务院信息化工作办公室副主任，主管电子政务和国际合作。<br><br>
2003年3月，任中央财经领导小组办公室副主任，分管宏观经济政策和经济发展方面工作。<br><br>
2011年3月至2013年3月，任中央财经领导小组办公室副主任，国务院发展研究中心党组书记。<br><br>
2012年11月，当选中共共产党第十八届中央委员会委员。<br><br>
2013年3月起，任中央财经领导小组办公室主任、国家发展和改革委员会副主任。<br><br>
《两次全球大危机的比较研究》是刘鹤负责的一项重要课题研究报告之总结。文章从历史大视角考察了20世纪30年代的大萧条和2008年爆发的全球金融危机，以粗线条勾画了两次危机大背景与表征的异同，做出了一些颇有见地、值得重视的观察与评论，并针对中国具体情况提出了三点很有价值的政策思考与建议。本版特此转载。<br><br>

　　本次危机爆发之后，我们一直在思考这次危机可能延续的时间、可能产生的深远国际影响和我们的对策。从2010年起，我们开始启动对20世纪30年代大萧条和本次国际金融危机的比较研究，邀请了中国人民银行、银监会、社科院、国务院发展研究中心、北京大学等单位的研究人员参加，这些单位都完成了十分出色的分报告，本文是此项研究的总报告。<br><br>

　　通过比较研究，关于两次危机的共同之处，我们侧重于从政治经济学的角度进行归纳。初步得到10点结论，简要描述如下：<br><br>

　　1.两次危机的共同背景是都在重大的技术革命发生之后。<br><br>

　　其警世意义在于，今后当重大的技术革命发生之后，不仅需要认识它的进步作用，抓住它带来的机遇，同时也要充分意识到重大变革会随之出现，充分估计震动性影响和挑战。<br><br>

　　2 在危机爆发之前，都出现了前所未有的经济繁荣，危机发源地的政府都采取了极其放任自流的经济政策。<br><br>

　　在两次繁荣期间，经济的自由放任和企业家创新精神的发扬互为补充，推动着经济的高增长，但也与后来危机的发生存在某种逻辑关系。<br><br>

　　3 收入分配差距过大是危机的前兆。<br><br>

　　两次危机发生前的另一个共同特点，是较少数的人占有较多的社会财富。这次危机最突出的表现是，生产资料名义所有权和实质支配权分离，权力集中到虚拟经济领域极少数知识精英手中。<br><br>

　　4 在公共政策空间被挤压得很小的情况下，发达国家政府所采取的民粹主义政策通常是危机的推手。<br><br>

　　技术变革和分配差距扩大造成的心理压力，往往会引起社会公众的不满，在执政期内无力改变现状和选票政治的推动下，政府倾向于更多地采取民粹主义政策宣示，安抚民心。<br><br>

　　民粹主义承诺改变了大众的福利预期，加大了对政府的依赖，也放松了自己的奋斗决心，是效果极其负面的腐蚀剂。致命问题是，一旦大众的福利预期得不到满足，社会心理很快发生逆转，并形成蔑视权威、拒绝变革和仇视成功者的强烈氛围。与此同时，超出收入能力的过度财政负债和福利主义相应成为一种习惯，这种习惯在政府和民间相互影响，其破坏力在目前的欧债危机中得到充分体现。<br><br>

　　5 大众的心理都处于极端的投机状态，不断提出使自己相信可以一夜致富的理由。<br><br>

　　两次危机前的产业神话和收入分配出现的巨大差距，往往导致资本主义制度下的社会心理状态出现变异。改变其社会地位的急切心情，使大众都开始追求一夜暴富，人们宁愿相信各种投机奇迹，人类本性中的贪婪和健忘达到前所未有的程度，没有多少人可以经受泡沫产业的诱惑……正如加尔布雷思所描述的，当经济处于过度繁荣状态的时候，没有人不相信泡沫会继续膨胀，人们不是找出理由使自己理性，而是找出理由使自己相信盲目冒险的正确性。<br><br>

　　6 两次危机都与货币政策相关联。在两次危机之前，最方便的手段是采取更为宽松的货币信贷政策。<br><br>

　　大萧条前，泛滥的信贷政策引起了股市的泡沫和投机的狂热；在这次危机前，美联储极其宽松的货币政策、金融放松监管和次级贷款都达到前所未有的水平，使得经济泡沫恶性膨胀。<br><br>

　　7 危机爆发后，决策者总是面临民粹主义、民族主义和经济问题政治意识形态化的三大挑战，市场力量不断挑战令人难以信服的政府政策，这使得危机形势更为糟糕。<br><br>

　　在面对严重危机的时候，主要国家在应对政策上总犯同样的错误，特别是应当采取行动的时候总会错过时机，应当采取宏观扩张政策的时候则采取紧缩政策，应当开放和进行国际合作的时候往往采取保护主义政策，应当压缩社会福利、推动结构改革的时候却步履艰难甚至反复和倒退。<br><br>

　　这些明显的错误在事后看起来显得可笑，但对当事人来说，实施正确的政策却困难重重。这是因为，大危机在人的一生中往往仅会遇到一次，决策者缺乏经验，又总是面临民粹主义、狭隘的民族主义和经济问题政治化这三座大山，政治家往往被短期民意绑架、被政治程序锁定和不敢突破意识形态束缚，这几乎是普遍的行为模式，这一点在最近的希腊危机中表现得最为明显。<br><br>

　　特别需要强调的是，两次危机中的市场力量从来都是高度政治化的力量。如果仅从经济角度认识问题而忽视其政治属性，就会犯重大的判断性错误。<br><br>

　　8 危机的发展有特定的拓展模式，在它完成自我延伸的逻辑之前，不可轻言经济复苏。<br><br>

　　在经济危机过程中，会发生很多意外事件，它们似乎是一些小概率事件，由运气决定。但事实并非如此。经济一旦从正常状态转入危机状态，它就开始以一种不同寻常的方式循环。危机往往从经济大幅跳水开始，由泡沫破裂走向失业率攀升，由经济困境加重转向社会矛盾激化，由经济社会领域转向政治领域乃至军事领域。<br><br>

　　当前特别需要重视的是，在危机自我逻辑实现的过程中总会出现意外事件，一连串的失控和误判也屡屡发生。目前，欧债危机正在深化，中东形势很不确定，经济、政治、社会、历史、文化等方面的冲突相互交织，在这种情况下，我们对本次危机可能出现的重大风险必须有充分的思想准备。<br><br>

　　9 危机只有发展到最困难的阶段，才有可能倒逼出有效的解决方案，这一解决方案往往是重大的理论创新。<br><br>

　　大萧条后，世界在绝望中发生了凯恩斯革命。这次理论创新可能围绕全球经济最实质和困难的问题展开：世界出现的总需求萎缩和资本、技术与劳动力在全球宏观配置失衡的局面，加上一些国家的经济增长陷入绝境，既带来本国的社会政治问题，也快速向全球传染，怎样解决这个问题尚无明确思路。<br><br>

　　10 危机具有强烈的再分配效应，它将导致大国实力的转移和国际经济秩序的重大变化。<br><br>

　　“基辛格定律”可能被再次验证。基辛格在他的名著《大外交》一书中开宗明义地指出，世界每隔百年会出现一个新的全球大国。这次危机发生后，全球发展的重心向亚太地区转移，二十国集团(G20)平台产生，世界实力对比正在急剧变动，国际经济秩序正在发生变化。从这个意义上看，危机不仅具有对生产力发展的破坏作用，也有积极的创新作用，更有强烈的再分配效应。<br><br>
